And I hope this is the right forum to start. First of all I'd like to tell that this is not intended to be bitching. I started to play story games, because classic RPGs haven't met my needs and story games promised me all the stuff I missed. But I still miss many things after having played some story games. Until now I've played Dogs in the Vineyard, Prime Time Adventures, 3:16, Universalis, Trollbabe and some others.<br/><br/>My problem is, that most of these games give the adventure and the session a structure which is same every time. This can be good theoretically. I mean there are some TV series I love, and the concept of TV serires are that the structure is always the same and the conflicts are always the same type. I don't know why, but I dislike this. It was very much fun in classic RPGs that I could make up an adventure with any structure I liked. It could be an 'arena' with locations the characters could travel, or it could be a 'railroad', like a road movie. It could be totally different from session to session. And the system didn't want to tell me how it should be played, I could GM as it naturally came to me.<br/><br/>I know, classic RPGs had their problems. There is no real catharsis if the players are confined to a strict suleset, they should have the ability to create the fiction, not only play it from start to end. I mean I totally used the players' creativity for example to think up NPCs on the fly, and my adventures are based more on the characters than the world. And I don't even want to have the power to choose the structure of the adventure, let the players turn the tables, surprise me and start to chase their chasers, for example. I totally love to give the players what they want even if I didn't expect it. Especially if I didn't expect it.<br/><br/>So I'm inclined from now on to play classic RPGs with light rules that won't hinder me and use story game like effects that will make the game more awesom and GM as I feel instead of listening to story games that want to tell me how to play.<br/><br/>Does anyone else have similar problems?<br/>Do you have any other solution for this problem?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306845/#Comment_306845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T19:26:51+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  7:26PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, a possible solution to your problem: Burning Wheel. I think it'll hit your sweet spot for GM/player interaction and GM authority.<br/><br/>Second, a little discussion.<br/><br/>Part of the thinking behind the games you mention is that the system <i>should</i> tell you how it should be played. If the system doesn't tell you how to play it, there's no reason to change systems. If, choosing a random system, Chaosium really lets you play every type of game, why use any other?<br/><br/>GMing as it comes to you is one mode of play, but some games ask you to change that to fit the game. That's part of what a game is: a set of rules that ask you to do things you wouldn't otherwise. Dogs has that structure because that's the structure the game is designed to support. Not supporting a different structure is no more a knock against the game than saying that a chair is not edible: it's not supposed to be.<br/><br/>So my suggestion is two-fold: when you want to play the style you're used to, play Burning Wheel. When you try something different, accept the style of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306846/#Comment_306846" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T19:29:36+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  7:29PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>My problem is, that most of these games give the adventure and the session a structure which is same every time.

But this also means greater input equality at the table, as well as a lessened workload for the usual pair of shoulders.<br/><br/>Of course, if putting on a one-man show was never a problem for you to begin with (in my case it was often a burden, and very often a shallow experience), then no application of contemporary game design thinking is ever going to fix what is not broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306847/#Comment_306847" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T19:37:54+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  7:37PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady blackbird &amp; apocalypse world don't fence you into a structure either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306849/#Comment_306849" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T20:08:01+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  8:08PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Algi,<br/><br/>No need to throw the baby out... keep what you like with traditional rpg.  And within that, there are a bunch of contemporary hacks to keep old souls amused.<br/><br/>There are many, many more indie rpgs than those you've mentioned.  A number of them have predetermined story arcs and narrative structures, which are radically different than the traditional models for rpg but fall within a nominal spectrum of difference so far as term "indie" would seem to connote.  But to reiterate, there's a lot more to offer you than what you've seen so far.  Dogs and 3:16 (so i'm told and AP seems to back up, though i've only ever played one-offs) can be handled as ongoing campaigns and as woolly as any trad game, in the hands of a good gm.<br/><br/>Fwiw, I find trying to shoe-horn rpg into television-like story arcs to be exact opposite of what i want in gaming.  Keep your eyes and your options open; and if you like old and new... then do both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306850/#Comment_306850" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T20:09:38+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  8:09PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In addition to those games listed above,<br/><br/>Sorcerer<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday<br/><br/>Those don't have any built in structure.<br/><br/>I'm surprise you included Trollbabe.

In my view Burning Wheel is a classical game, and so is Dogs in The Vineyard, 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars, and all these new games with GM's in them. How they are <i>published</i> ("indie") is of no consequence to me when playing them.<br/><br/>I find Dogs a very nice game, but you are right: it is built for specific purposes, and as such it may be conceived as a bit narrow.<br/><br/>3:16 is a strong game too, but alas; built for the very special purpose of telling the dirty story of blood and betrayal in space.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel is a heavier game, and not one to suit my tastes. The resolution-system is too cumbersome for my taste; it takes too much of the interactive space, and leaves to little room for improvisation and immersion. But a lot of people actually praise it for its innovative system, so it may be what you need.<br/><br/>I would like to give you a better recommendation, but I fear that you'll have to create your own game anyhow, to match the high standards you expect. I would advice you to look for new games of the classical type, though, and perhaps something that is a bit lighter on the system-side than Burning Wheel. Which game that should be I cannot tell; the ones I know are all Norwegian ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gyroland" title="gyroland"><img alt="gyroland" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gyroland">gyroland</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306870/#Comment_306870" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T02:37:20+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  2:37AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2011 2:38AM by gyroland.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            G\xe1bor,<br/><br/>I also wasn't exactly satisfied when i tried some of the so called story-games. Now, this is a bit a shot in the dark, but i've been thinking and i think that 1 play session is probably not enough to have a good feel of a game, i think to know how to play well, needs at least a couple of sessions. Well, the other option would be to play with someone who knows a given game well enough, but here in Hungary that is not exactly an option. Or i just didn't know the right people <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also, Apocalypse World was suggested here, and i bought that so maybe we can try to arrange a session.<br/><br/><a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/" rel="nofollow">Shadow of Yesterday</a> is also a good suggestion, because i think you can GM it with traditional mindset, and the system itself adds some new-wave rules.

Add me to the group of people who are confused about what "the problem" is. It sounds like there is something about these games that you wish you were getting out of them, but you can't achieve with most of the games you've tried. Can you tell us more about that, maybe give an example of what sort of thing you'd want to do, but can't using one of those games?<br/><br/>It IS notable that the indie design mindset is one that's leaning very much away from One System you can use for everything and much more towards a variety of games that each do one (or two) things really well. I think the theoretical "hardcore indie gamer" <i>expects</i> to play a variety of games, not to find One System with which to run everything. The idea is very much that if you want a different experience, you play a different game.<br/><br/>That said, I find a lot of "indie games/story games" provide such powerful tools for story creation that they can be used much more flexibly than the basic text often suggests. For instance, if you like Dogs in the Vineyard, there's no reason you couldn't use the same rules to play out a Victorian drama (ignoring the Town Creation rules). <br/><br/>Yeah, some things might get a little funny (for instance, expect some violence in places you might not normally see it, and vice-versa) and you might run into some problems if you don't give it some thought first... but that's not that unusual. Playing out a Victorian drama with D&amp;D would be a whole harder than playing out a Victorian drama with Dogs. Same with most other "traditional" systems I can think of. <br/><br/>If you ignore the modules published for D&amp;D, why can't you ignore the Town Creation procedure in Dogs?<br/><br/>That said:<br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday (specifically the Solar System version) is a great general-purpose tool that is genre-independent and feels very traditional in some ways. Same for the underlying engine for Lady Blackbird as well as FATE/Spirit of the Century. None specify a particular length of play or scene structure, or say too much about adventure design.<br/><br/>None of these games are like, say, My Life with Master or The Mountain Witch, which really put you into a specific story, and might be harder to "hack" into different types of stories.<br/><br/>There are also some great generic, free resolution systems like The Pool or Otherkind Dice, which can be used as-is or even combined with other rulesets.<br/><br/>So, what are you missing in those games that you can do more easily in other games? Is it genre, or story conventions, or something else? Or is it that you just prefer the more "traditional" games to these "indie" games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306917/#Comment_306917" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T09:44:36+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  9:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also entirely possible, of course, that you played some of those games "wrong" (and by "wrong" I mean, "in a way that's not as fun as the way the designer intended"). <br/><br/>Imagine trying to play D&amp;D from the book without ever having seen anyone else play it... the first session might not go all that well, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306920/#Comment_306920" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T09:57:01+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  9:57AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Burning Other Stuff games maybe, but not so much Burning Wheel.

I can't really speak to AW, since I've only leafed through a friend's copy, but LB definitely is extremely structured. It's a module, for chrissakes!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Can't let that go...<br/><br/>So I thought we were talking about plot structure.  Acts, scenes, and how they fill your session.  One group might play LB all the way to a meeting with Uriah Flint and a showdown with Count Carlowe in one session (I think Jesse's group did that on Actual People Actual Play);  another group may spend an entire session sabotaging the Hand of Sorrow.<br/>And assuming you're taking more than one session to play a short run of LB, your first session structure (starting in medias res and when you have your refreshment scenes and climaxes) will probably be quite different from your second session which will probably be different from your third.<br/><br/>But I didn't notice Universalis was in the list.  I can't imagine that fencing someone into a particular structure either, so I don't know if this is what Gabor was really talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306953/#Comment_306953" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T11:56:45+00:00" title="January  5, 2011 11:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gabor,<br/><br/>Is it the desposible nature of these games that bothers you?

Matter: sin, judgement, community, faith... Form: initiation-town-judgement-reflection-town-judgement-reflection...<br/><br/>PTA is strong on form, but has no matter. Form is always the episodic tv show format. But matter can be anything. The Wire is unlike BSG is unlike Seinfield in a way no two Dogs games can be different.<br/><br/>3:16 is pretty tight on both, too. Form is mission-downtime-mission... 3:16 also carries a decent thematic punch. Nothing deep but palpable.<br/><br/>Universalis ok, here's where we start hitting problems. I don't really see any such structure in Universalis. I'm not super-familiar with it, but I'm at loss.<br/><br/>Trollbabe, same. The matter is whatever your questions are, and the form is not really pre-supposed. I'm not seeing it.<br/><br/>So yeah, it might be good to know what structure means in this context.<br/><br/>I tried thinking about other games in this way.<br/>*oD&amp;D...out of the box this is pretty darn structured. What you do is you get treasure, spend it, get treasure. Level up, zero to hero. Get a castle or church, retire. It is decisively picaresque in its progress. <br/>*mid-period D&amp;D...a lot more loose, XP is awarded for killing monsters/overcoming the opposition which technically gives you a lot more maneuver space with your subject matter. There's is still the level-up form, but it's not that rigid. In almost all instances the level-related character positioning is also gone, so there's definitely less structure there.<br/>*4E D&amp;D...quite tight in form. You can do other stuff but by the book each game is a series of encounters. You can see the same trend in late-period 3E &amp; Pathfinder with adventure paths. Compared to earlier editions encounters are far more complex and in the forefront (instead of exploration), so encounters is where the game is at, which requires a pretty tight path.<br/><br/>Vampire tM. The subject matter is implied but not explicitly supported by the rules (which is why the game caught a lot of flak in some circles), very loose there imo. The form is pretty loose but the book talks a lot about how the storyteller should build their chronicles, so there's definitely an underlying form to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306990/#Comment_306990" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T14:30:18+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  2:30PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite><br/>My problem is, that most of these games give the adventure and the session a structure which is same every time.

I love the focus of story games, but the turn based nature of many indie games doesn't leave room for that kind of non-linear discovery. <br/><br/>GMing is a creative art,  but part of this game design movement was about delineating what things a GM might do, and systematizing it. One baby we threw out with the bathwater was leaving many doors open to the GM for framing, type of adventure, form of adversity, choosing what part of the system to call on. <br/><br/>I think Diaspora is a game that was written to create many tools and paths for the GM, by having many subsystems. And games like Archipelago II return to a looser structure for scenes to be framed and adventures but I don't know if the GM has the same central role that you may be looking for. <br/><br/>I'm certain you're not alone though, in  your reactions to the games. A friend in Norway (Maja) wrote about feeling the same way in an essay in RPGirl last summer:<br/><br/><i>I find a lot of indie games to be one or the other: either too artsy for me to understand or enjoy, or too narrow, seeing no other path to go than the one already chalked out.

What kinds of features inhibit that type of gaming?<br/><br/>A lot of indie games are designed to get straight to the action, to move along the plot quickly. So that intention is definitely there. But I don't see anything about a lot of "trad" games that facilitate that kind of gaming, either. (Yes, I realize that what you're talking about isn't really "trad" - I suppose I'm really just using the term to mean "non-mainstream indie" in this context.) Is there a reason you could spend several hours discussing how magic works in a game of Ars Magica (by ignoring most of the written rules, right?) but not in Dogs (by similarly ignoring most of the rules)? What's the difference?<br/><br/>Admittedly, I've never tried to run an indie game with the mindset of a long, slow build. But I don't really see how I couldn't. Say we got together and decided, "Let's play through a single Dogs Town over the course of about a dozen sessions," and then played out through every conversation my Dog has when he meets his father in the Town and sits down to have a meal with him before going out to talk to the Steward the next day, or walks down by the river to spend a few hours with his old flame... what would stop us? Where would we go wrong?<br/><br/>I've never tried it, but I don't see how, if that were our goal, the rules in play would really stop us more than Ars Magica or D&amp;D or whatever else.\n<blockquote>Plus, ignore town creation? Heck, why play Dogs then? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nWell, you definitely miss out on a lot of the game... but if you want to do something different, why not? The Dogs conflict mechanics by themselves have a lot to offer: dynamic escalation, intense conflicts, rich characterization within conflicts, an ability to scale smoothly from arguments to car chases, interesting and fluid character development. Lots of people play D&amp;D without a battlemat or without monsters, or without magical items... why not Dogs without Towns?

I like characters and conflicts to develop over time and for multiple parallel threads to arise. I've been playing for a few years games which break down the narrative without respect to place or time and I've found it wonderfully freeing - assuming you have system elements that support you. But most importantly resolving your conflict is no longer the default cost for advancing through the system, you can often withhold resolution until it better suits the overall story structure you want. <br/><br/> - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307090/#Comment_307090" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T09:05:30+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  9:05AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the issue with long bouts of free play being discouraged by the "indie" games is perhaps based on the assumption that such free play suggests avoidance of broken mechanics such to enjoy the game, the players avoid the mechanics. However, I think Emily is suggesting that may not always be the case. Perhaps sometimes we like the extended free play because we just want to relax a bit and enjoy adding depth of color to our games.<br/><br/>I'm not sure the "indie" games need actually be played to totally avoid free play, there's no reason we can't also relax with some of them and enjoy the free play. Perhaps it's better to look at ways to allow players who have become tired of the free play to push buttons and engage the mechanics again, in a productive way. What we don't want to do is encourage the dysfunctional play where the bored player starts pushing buttons (literally or figuratively) out of frustration.<br/><br/>In my current Burning Wheel campaign, we have had some free play.

Jeep and live play offer a lot more, which is part of what I enjoy about them. In your second paragraph, Frank is that dynamic satisfying? Where folks say "jump to the conflict"? If you're finding it a useful technique to be able to not founder in boring or unproductive free play, that seems positive. But if it is essentially making the game:  Play, Conflict, Rinse, Repeat, I question that. There may be different ways to address the issue, and there may be other directions to head than always capping with a conflict. Remember Tomorrow includes the option to make things a "color scene" if  you don't arrive at a conflict. This is one small thing, but it is a relief to not always have to live up to that requirement. <br/><br/>And to stop the threadjacking, Eppy Ravachol has a standard rant that may address Gabor's issues. He calls it the Archipelago and the River Delta metaphor. Archipelago play (as distinct from playing Matthijs' Archipelago specifically) deals with navigating through the ocean of free play, and touching down on mechanics when the mood and moment are right. Hopping from island to island, there are a plethora of rules that can be invoked, and they are (when things are working correctly) when it is both right and desired. There's a huge amount of room for Rule Zero here. It's raised event to an aesthetic philosophy, which may be how it was intended all the time (but can be used to cover a world of errors). A River Delta game is one where the rules focus your play like the river banks do. You are not left to wonder where you should be headed, the rules hand you off from free play in the water to the next set of procedures. <br/><br/>Now the River Delta is likely to be very dependable. You're less liable to get lost, or hit uncharted rocks in the water. But it's a completely different experience, and may be suited to different skills. Playing a primarily free-play game you are susceptible to the storms of player discontent, or may let you be beached on the shoals of GM burnout. The River Delta makes it much easier for anyone to pick up the role of GM/navigator. And this kind of structure is well suited to more distributed, multi-GM play. If there is not just one hand at the wheel, then having rules for how the many hands work together makes sense. <br/><br/>But is that the only way? Certainly not. And of course, there is a lot of variation among all the games we've been talking about. And likely less variation if we actually took a hard, rigorous look at the trad play we may nostalize over. But, there's surely much uncharted water, and this may be some of that territory. <br/><br/>I think there are some very interesting possibilities for us if we look closely at what Gabor might be missing. Frex, the simple things like varying the adventure from an all out combat to being a pleasure jaunt through new country, to facing puzzles that the players have to mull over and struggle with. Now, that doesn't mean  at all that games can't give him what he's looking for (if I'm understanding him right, and please correct me) but a point that I think we should take from this, is that we might want to keep expanding our horizons here. There is a pleasure to, as a GM, be able to take the reigns and sculpt an endlessly varied campaign. And since trad games offer that flexibility but perhaps don't offer as much support for a game groups as would be liked, we have a huge opportunity here to do what he asks: apply lessons learned to different kinds of structures. <br/><br/>If some of the rules of thumb we have developed (ie "where's the conflict") give us a repetitious experience, we can look at that trend in a meta way, and realize that we can keep developing beyond that. <br/><br/>Or not, that's fine too. Chess is also: move, resolve, move, resolve. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307103/#Comment_307103" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T10:45:01+00:00" title="January  6, 2011 10:45AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Algi,<br/><br/>I hear ya.

Is that already too constraining?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307106/#Comment_307106" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T10:56:25+00:00" title="January  6, 2011 10:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, Emily, I really want you to join my Delve campaign!

I GMed a long running campaign and we had all kinds of scenes and story arcs, based around what the players were interested in. There were one-on-one arena fights, discoveries, long journeys and quests, large scale battles on land and sea, tender moments of resolution between characters, contests, and more. Antagonists at various times included horrible sorcerers, pirates, orcs, a leviathan, political rivals, and even each other - again, all based on what the players wanted - what we talked about for each arc and what they wrote in their Beliefs. <br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307113/#Comment_307113" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T11:23:45+00:00" title="January  6, 2011 11:23AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that Algi's problem would be easily solved with a simple game like <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.randomordercreations.com/rpg.html" rel="nofollow">The Pool</a>: it's not so much a problem of "trad vs dirty hippie games" as a problem of considering a too narrow vision of what there is out there apart from what this week is considered a "storygame" and the "traditional" ones  (a more fruitful division would not be between "storygames" and "traditional games", but between "the way rpgs were played traditionally" and "all the other possible ways")<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily's point is much more interesting.

Any other interesting examples? How to Host a Dungeon?</blockquote>\nWell, Ribbon Drive is about going on a road trip and discovering yourself. Mechanically, one of the things that play centers around are the characters' Futures: statements about what they want and think will happen in the future. The way Futures work is that, over the course of play, Futures are woven into conversations and reflected upon.<br/><br/>The game invites you to let go of your Futures, to realize that they don't really matter, to learn to live in the present. An important part of play, the climactic moment, is when someone let's go of all of their Futures.<br/><br/>Now, in a way, that's about conflict, you could say. The conflict between goals and the present. The conflict between two visions of yourself. But, that's a definition of conflict that's spread so thin it becomes meaningless - when you decide how you'll cook your eggs in the morning, that's not a conflict, that's just you living and being. IMO.<br/><br/>So, that's how Ribbon Drive does it. There aren't really opposing forces. There's just you, deciding what sort of force you are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307196/#Comment_307196" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T22:10:45+00:00" title="January  6, 2011 10:10PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>Does anyone else have similar problems?</blockquote> Nope.\n<blockquote>Do you have any other solution for this problem?</blockquote>When I want to play a game about Mormon Paladins riding into town fixin things, I play DitV.

This is especially true of <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, and <i>Primetime Adventures</i>. I can attribute a lot of that, on reflection, to us making room for a lot of free play to establish and connect with fictional material.<br/><br/>In fact, in my local <i>Wicked Age</i> play it's pretty much become like clockwork - nearly all chapters take two sessions, and the first session is guaranteed to be free-play heavy, as we sink our teeth into the characters and their situation. Then there's a tipping point, either toward the end of the first session or the beginning of the second, and then it's conflict conflict conflict until most of what's up for grabs is resolved one way or another. That second session looks a lot more like what's described in <i>Wicked Age</i> AP and other Internet discussions I've read. So I can't really tell if this happens in other groups, or if everyone else is approaching the thing with a much greater sense of urgency than I usually do, or what.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307283/#Comment_307283" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T10:07:58+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 10:07AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leonard, it sounds like you Circle Around Conflict at the start, then Rush Up To Conflict at the end (paraphrasing terminology). Totally within the RAW, and probably a preferable standard procedure for campaign play.<br/><br/>In my own experience, mostly with con games, there's no time to Circle or Tease Out... Rush, if I want to wrap a chapter in three hours and have time at the end for showing how a new chapter starts (to demo the "whole" system, if not the whole experience of campaign play).<br/>-----<br/>How many threads we got going in here, now?

Perhaps it's better to look at ways to allow players who have become tired of the free play to push buttons and engage the mechanics again, in a productive way. What we don't want to do is encourage the dysfunctional play where the bored player starts pushing buttons (literally or figuratively) out of frustration.</p>\n<p>In my current Burning Wheel campaign, we have had some free play. When it seems to be going on too long, someone asks where's the conflict, and we then either wrap up the free play as not generating conflict, or find some conflict in the situation, and resolve it.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I kinda just want to point to what you're saying.</p>\n<p>We've learned to make trustworthy systems that deliver what they promise, and to make promises only for things they can deliver.</p>\n<p>I'm excited to see a full integration of fiction with mechanics, where what the fictional situation is what has the greatest impact, where we get character exposition instead of character creation, and where exploring your character and their environment is procedurally supported.</p>\n<p>Polaris gives a view of this and my understanding is that Apocalypse World does, too. Human Contact is doing what it can by expanding into the deliberate voids in Shock:s design, but I think we're all going to be put to shame in the next year or two.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307329/#Comment_307329" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T12:49:15+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 12:49PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2011 12:50PM by Emily_Care.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Edit: Emily, what happens typically when people play Fluffy Bunnies?</blockquote>\nTouche! However, my observations were that the "every scene must have it's conflict" can create repetitious and less commonly in-character play. Fluffy Bunny is the example game for how it is boring to never have a conflict, and but surprisingly, whenever I play it is strangely satsifying to simply imagine hopping, eating etc. as a bunny! (It is a remarkably short game however.)<br/><br/>Back to the play-conflict-play-conflict issue. A thought occurred to me about Chess, which I mentioned above as an example of that. It's not. You move pieces on the board, strategize and watch the other's plays, and eventually conflicts happen. Also, there is one overarching conflict: who will catch the other's King. But neither of these things makes the game in its pacing and its dynamics feel like an rpg where you must end every scene with a conflict. Even if we instead said "let's sometimes begin with a conflict", you are suddenly have a different feel. Then you would play out the aftermath of whatever conflict happened rather than the lead up. Very interesting! Also, saying "let's not break up our play into scenes that each focus on one character" (which is a very common structure in games these days) would change things. <br/><br/>Mara has a single event that touches all the characters, with traits given that people spin off from, presuming, and reliably creating conflicts between players. The conflicts are all emergent. They will be there, but one never calls for one per se. You do, however, have very structured scenes that give space to the characters resolving a conflict they have carried with Mara (who has died) and letting it go. That does not fit neatly into any category we generally think about when we talk about conflict resolution--but then, it's a different type of play where the resolution or closure is gained by seeing what the player brings. Jeep does this too, and in many of those games you may have alternate takes to give you different flavors of the character, lead up to conflicts, their resolution--or not--and their fall out and integration into new events.<br/><br/>Leonard, your comments are re-assuring. And remind me that my experiences have varied much also. Playing IAWA was a great experience for me in somewhat lengthy in-character exploration. And one of my very favorite games of my own game Shooting the Moon, was played in Finnland with Swedes (bless them) who when they had control of when to cut to the conflict, let the sweet emotions of the scene unfold, and showed me whole new dimensions of the game.<br/><br/>Edited to add: Yes to what Joshua said. I look forward to that too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307332/#Comment_307332" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T13:13:01+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  1:13PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly. I'm in total agreement with the desire for more character exposition, exploration of environments, etc. Playing conflict-conflict-conflict will, of course, get stale sooner or later, at least for some of us.<br/><br/>What I'm not seeing (as Leonard's anecdote shows) is any coherent argument for why or how "indie/story" games facilitate that kind of thing less well than "traditional" games.<br/><br/>In other words, if you miss having exposition scenes, long stretches where nothing happens (and I mean that in the most positive way), and similar slow-paced techniques of story-telling... why does that suggest a return to more traditional systems, as the OP is suggesting?<br/><br/>I'm all for slow-paced stories. But what's the connection between that and some kind of dichotomy between "trad" and "indie" games? I definitely see a difference in terms of <i>play culture</i>, yes. For sure. But I'd love to hear more about what it is in terms of <i>design</i> that facilitates that kind of play. Because from my own limited experience I see no reason I can't have drawn-out free play in In a Wicked Age..., or Dogs, or pick-your-own-game-here, just as easily as I can in a game of D&amp;D or Call of Cthulhu or GURPS.<br/><br/>I see two related issues, and both interesting ones:<br/><br/>1. How does existing game design push us towards faster story motion (more conflicts resolved per unit of time) or slower story motion (fewer conflicts resolved in the same span of time)? What components of, say, D&amp;D facilitate one versus the other?<br/><br/>(I suspect handling elements of escalation in various different ways is an important variable to consider here.)<br/><br/>2. How can we design games that aren't based on the creation and resolution of conflicts? What areas for design exist here that are still untouched?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaochou" title="chaochou"><img alt="chaochou" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaochou">chaochou</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307336/#Comment_307336" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T14:17:11+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  2:17PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could I suggest HeroWars / Heroquest (I've only run 1st edition) to the OP?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's certainly very little that tells a GM 'how to run this game' in the same way that, say, DitV does.

I definitely can't wait for the really slow burn, like the open-ended campaign.<br/><br/>I really do think that having some time off improves play experience. It's kinda like the pilot of a show, especially a two-parter. It gives you time to think a bit and come up with other cool, more subtle stuff. Done well, or even kinda well, the next session is even better. Characters develop, GMs posit all kinds of cool possibilities to interact with.<br/><br/>Too open-ended and too long and commitments fade. Sessions are missed.

Defined character classes, 20 levels, strict character progression, and a rewards system focused around killing monsters. That, right there, informs a specific story structure. AD&amp;D was never really The One System at all; it did a handful of story types. D&amp;D (the various boxed sets) was even more focused in its storytelling.<br/><br/>I think the confusion with "classic" RPG's is that, since they were the only things available at the time, we <i>used</i> them for everything. How many games did you play where the DM said "In my campaign, Elves have these rules modifications" and so forth. We constantly made house-rules for things because the actual game did not provide guidance for the thing we wanted to do. We ignored the rules if they got in our way. But the thing is, the system was designed to tell a particular kind of story, so we <i>had</i> to hack in those rules to cover things for which there were no systems.<br/><br/>The lack of structure in a game is not a good thing. The structure in an RPG exists to direct, inspire, and inform the storytelling that game is shooting for. If you break the structure of the game - as was often the case with classic RPG's - you're basically just making your own game entirely. The key is to find a game whose structure informs the kind of story you want to tell.<br/><br/>tl;dr: Don't look for the Swiss army knife RPG.

Here are some examples.<br/><br/><i>Primetime Adventures</i>, 2nd Ed, page 3: "Each time you play a game of Primetime Adventures, you and the other players create... one episode of a fictional TV show... At the end of a game session, which usually takes a few hours, the characters on the show will have completed one episode of that show..." (This assumption is explicitly carried through the book - one session = one episode, period.)<br/><br/>page 31: "Don't hesitate to get right into the conflict, especially the first few times you play the game. It can be easy to start talking and describing and maybe acting out dialogue (you know, however you like doing it), and the next thing you know, <i>fifteen minutes</i> (emphasis added) of play time passed and no conflict. Oops."<br/><br/><i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, back of box: "30-60 Minutes"<br/><br/><i>In a Wicked Age</i>, 1st printing, page 25: "End the chapter when... You've been playing long enough and are at a perfect cliffhanger. / You're plain out of time." "Everyone else, gather up the sheets, cards, and dice, clean up the snacks, and finish the wine. Wish your friends a dear good night; the chapter's done." (This is the softest of these injunctions, but the frame story that the text relies on implies at other points that all the stuff that happens in the book happens in one night.)<br/><br/>The Dogs example is already above, re: pushing toward conflict.<br/><br/><i>Shock:</i>, page 17: "About 45 minutes to an hour per player"<br/><br/>...And so on and so forth, ad nauseum. Now, obviously, one might argue that absent of this provided context, the mechanics themselves don't enforce this kind of urgency or time limit the way that, say, <i>Zombie Cinema</i> or <i>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i> does. Perhaps nothing tangible actually forces you into that mode. But I think the context counts for a lot, enough that it lends validity to the perception that "traditional" games are freer or more facilitating in this regard. Yeah, there's structure, but there's less there telling you to apply that structure in a particular way if you don't much feel like it.<br/><br/>For some groups, that's a feature, and for some, it's a bug. For Jason Corley, it's a way of life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307467/#Comment_307467" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T15:32:01+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  3:32PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>How do Ribbon Drive and A Flower for Mara deal with conflict?</blockquote>\nWell, actually, <i>A Flower for Mara</i> handles conflict purely at the social level.

It's just a suggested Pacing Mechanic. <br/><br/>I find "Drive Towards Conflict" does shorten free play time, but in a good way. There is a point at which just being in character with no direction gets frustrating, or causes some of the other players to lose interest.  I feel the time to be just in character is the time to push your characters agenda or develop an aspect of your character; and that mean there is some conflict, else there is no drama or story. This conflict may not be resolved as in  a color scene, but it is the setup for future conflict.  A player who has a color scene about his dislike like of the Irish it setting up a future conflict with the Irish.   Free Play may not end with a die role but it ends pointing to a future conflict.  Games where the players write down goals or motivations are helpful, it allows the player to have a direction when his character has free play time (Burning Wheel, Don't Rest your head, The Shadow of Yesterday)<br/><br/>"Drive Towards Conflict" gives the GM a way to get the play back on track with out having to railroad, and to bring the focus like in a novel or movie to the action and not the drive across town. I think of "Drive Toward Conflict" as a matter of scope each group will have their own level of detail at which they will desire to play.   I just find I like a faster pace story and do not need to cover the details of a long trek, with unnecessary encounters, if the story we want to tell is about the mystery they will discover at their destination. That was always my frustration with D&amp;D was random encounters whose only purpose was experience points, to make the travel to our destination difficult, and to use up resources.<br/><br/>Adam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308999/#Comment_308999" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T17:44:15+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  5:44PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi! I'm back! I didn't have the time until now to answer, because worky-worky-worky. (Damian: The assumption of ranting really hurt. And even if I wouldn't answer, it's possible that I'm reading the posts.) OMG, so much feedback, that's terrific, and I'm really ashame that I can't each and everyone one by one, but that would totally butcher the whole thing here and I'm not sure I have the time. (I mean I have the freetime, but my memory and concentration isn't that long.)<br/><br/>Now, the problem I tried to address is twofold. First, it's very simple: I don't know enough games. Second, it's very complex: what I want from an RPG.<br/><br/>About Universalis and structure: Yes, it gives the possibility to make up any structuring by the players. But the way how the players communicate, dispute and decide is structured quite strictly. And if I take this structure away, then nothing remains. Of course everything can be changed in Universalis, but if we change that beforehand, than it's not Universalis, it would be called RPG designing. If we change it using the rules of Universalis, then it's structure kicks in at start. And if we don't use it's rules for narration and conflicts, then we have nothing again.<br/><br/>Dogs without town creation: My problem with Dogs was that the conflicts were strictly stuctured. I didn't have any problem with town creation, town creation is awesome, because it helps me to write one type of adventure. That's useful if I want that kind of adventure. But each and every conflict goes on the same.<br/><br/>And that is what my problem is with this kind of concentrated RPGs. In a fictional story there are several different types of conflicts which all work differently. I love to have universal rules: to have the same rule for social and combat conflicts, but if there is a conflict, I can't change anything, because everything is covered by the rules.<br/><br/>And this is where the creativity comes in. In a traditional game I could make up anything. I was free to make up fiction that would change the rules and the rules still told me what is it becoming of the situation. (I knew when a sword slashed or when a magic worked, but I could do two things: color the slash and the magic or bring in game changing warriors and magic powers.) But in concentrated games the rules don't say what's happening in the fiction, but mandates the players and the GM to come up with something. Trollbabe sais: "you have a partial success in making sure that noone follows you, now come up with something what that means." And I say: well, thank you very much, every time the dice are rolled, I _have_ to come up with something that works. And it doesn't even change the future. What I'm coming up with is only color. It doesn't affect what happens next, only the dice will decide what happens next. We could just roll the dice all the way through the conflict.<br/><br/>And conflicts are not that obvious. An NPC wants to get an information from a PC. An NPC gives an information to a player just to affect him/her. The NPC does only this and then waits. How can I make this conflict by using Trollbabe or Dogs? I can't. Because it's subtle. You can't make subtle, chronic conflicts in these games. You can make only WHAM conflicts. With ALL IMPORTANT outcomes. Which can be awesome. For example I love 3:16 with all its structuredness. I'd love to play it again.<br/><br/>Sage: I think it's true that a system without telling me how to play, still helps a type of play and hinders other types of play. It's quite obvious even without GNS. (And please, people, I don't want to discuss GNS here, I was just saying.) So I can't play almost anything with Chaosium.<br/><br/>David: I hope you remember your question. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> For some time I'm trying to GM like that. First coming up with a party concept, than generate PCs in that concept, and then coming up with adventures based on those characters. For me that's quite evident. For me it wouldn't make sense to write "Adventures" and then have characters try to solve them. I mean I'm not a pro, but I'm concerning about scriptwriting, and in the story everything is around the characters: the need, the goal, the change. The whole story is based upon the troubles of the characters, or it becomes boring. But this time the players decide whether they follow their need or their goal. And it's upon them whether they realize what their need is. (And I don't write their needs, it's the system and the setting that gives the needs of a character.) Okay, it's not that conscious when I play, but I keep it in my mind.<br/><br/>And AD&amp;D is very much structured, I didn't mean AD&amp;D by trad games. Here, in Hungary, AD&amp;D was not that popular. When RPGs got popular, it was because of a Hungarian game which was although based on AD&amp;D, but it was much more freeform. It had levels and monsters, but it much more advertised freeform than dungeoncrawl. Its setting offered many adventures without any dungeons. (I don't think it's because of some kind of value judgment, it has rather kinda historical reasons.)<br/><br/>FATE worked for me earlier, and I think I have some other ideas. And thanks for the feedback again. (If this post seems somewhat unfinished, it's because I forgot what I wanted to say. Sorry.)<br/><br/>G\xe1bor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309001/#Comment_309001" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T18:04:16+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  6:04PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gabor,<br/><br/>Good to have you back in the thread.

Playing doesn't only "conflicts" or "freeform play". There are NPCs with agendas who give information to the players benevolently or malevolently, manipulatively. Or they want to have some information of the players. Or they just want to make connections to the PCs. These all can have first and foremost importance without having a conflict from start to end. So it's not only either freeform play or rolling the dice, there can be important dramatic scenes which can be categorized as conflicts or parts of conflicts which are to complex because of their social nature (or if it's magic, because of the metaphysical phylosophie of the setting) to just roll the dice for it.<br/><br/>It's no solution to label some acts as conflicts, then awesomifying them into superconflicts, then make everything else unimportant. Sometimes it's enough if the rules for fight isn't just rolling for attack than damage, but to make it a bit more realistic or adjustable to pacing and let the players use them to build their own adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309004/#Comment_309004" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T18:35:08+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  6:35PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2011 6:54PM by algi.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm happy that it's fascinating, because I love to talk about how I GM. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/><br/><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>And conflicts are not that obvious.

You can't make subtle, chronic conflicts in these games</blockquote>\nSo, how would you handle this situation/conflict in this AD&amp;D-like game you're referring to? How would it go in play? What would that look like?<br/><br/>(I hope I'm not abusing quoting here.)<br/><br/>Well, while playing traditional RPGs I concerned to come up with some kind of adventure writing (or rather session writing) and GMing technique. Because I realized, it's not enough to go along how I feel, but if I want the players have fun, and myself to have fun, then I have to listen to their reactions and consciously build methods that will help me. (I know, I start the story a bit far, sorry.)<br/><br/>And I had two inspiration which blew my mind: one was "Morphology of the Folktale" and the other was an RPG branded fantasy novel which depicted magic exactly as it would work by the RPG rules (so it was not just a fantasy story in the setting, but it was in the system, too). And I realized that roleplaying is not controlling characters in an endless fantasy world, but it's functions that the GM uses to affect the characters and the players. So I started to classify these functions as mechanic ones (like the PCs have to fight) and dramatic ones (an NPC gives an information to a PC). And since then adventure writing consists for me of putting these functions into structures. When playing it's up to the players, how they move around the structure and activate the functions.<br/><br/>For example there was a male character in the party who was fond of the ladies (and this is an understatement). You have to know, that tihs was a road adventure: the PCs were escorting nobles across the mountains to a city. So I made up a female NPC (the daughter of the head of the noble family) whose goal was to get him to trust her and after they arrive, to make him kill someone she didn't like.<br/><br/>So I came up with stages: I made a thread of dramatic functions and each function consisted of something she did to get his trust. The first was that she got behind him when enemies attacked. The second was that she asked something (I wrote down beforehand what she asked). The third was that she invited him to her tent for some talking about trusting people and asking whether he killed anyone before. Etc.<br/><br/>So while playing I had this list before me, and whenever an opportunity came, I activated the next item on the list, but I didn't push it. If the opportunity for it didn't arise, I didn't do it. And if the PC could anytime stop the progression down the list, but I knew the player enough that he will want to know what will be at the end (he hoped for sex, and his character got it after he gave his word to kill that someone). So it seemed natural, and it gave the feeling of progression without real awkward railroading. (This may be railroading, but it didn't feel like that.)<br/><br/>And the adventure consisted of such lists: another list was that of the stronger and stronger enemies who attacked them on the road (mechanic functions which consisted almost exclusively of combat values), a third one was the declining health of the head of the noble family, etc. So there are lists enough to have a full adventure even if one of the threads won't work. So you can't say that this female character was a conflict, you can't even say that the first fight was a conflict. These were four or five long conflicts which played out I think under four or five session.<br/><br/>And I can vary how these lists or threads are to each other and how they work intrinsincly. For example if the adventure is set in a city, the threads could be places in the city the adventure travel around from one place to another, and the items of the list would be more and more hidden truth they can unravel.<br/><br/>So maybe I dislike concentrated games, because I can't use this method. It wouldn't be a problem, but mostly the GMing methods of these concentrated games don't work so well for me as mine above. I don't know, maybe I designed my own RPG and I don't even know it.<br/><br/>(OFF: If anyone thinks, that I totally butchered the English language, consider this: I'm making my money by translating.

But isn't that true of most RPGs' combat systems? (I don't know what combat system you use: What does it look like in your game when the characters get into a fight?)<br/><br/>However, I don't see (at least not yet, from what you've said here) how a relatively light, generic conflict resolution system (e.g. the Pool, or PTA) wouldn't allow to play in this style. Heck, even when I run Dogs, we often skip the mechanics if the freeform roleplaying is giving us what we want. While it depends on the group, it's usually quite workable to be able to say, "Hey, let's bring the mechanics in here, they would enhance this scene/moment", or, "Guys, do we need to go to dice over this? ... No? Great, let's just keep playing this out."<br/><br/>In most systems I'm aware of (including Dogs), the situation you're describing could easily be played freeform, with no harm done to the rest of the system or the rest of the session.<br/><br/>Specific conflict mechanics certainly do tend to default to a certain weight of importance or screen-time. Dogs conflicts are usually intense, drawn-out, meaningful, and take up a lot of play time. Same for, e.g. D&amp;D combat mechanics. But a relatively generic conflict resolution game (e.g. The Pool) or a generic task resolution game (e.g. Fudge, GURPS without simplified combat) will make any situation where you do go to the dice go by pretty easily and lightly, whether you like it or not. I'm not sure what the difference is! It's totally valid to play a Stakes-setting game, for example, and set high stakes ("Do you live?") in one scene, and then very low stakes ("Does she notice that you brought eleven roses instead of twelve?/Can you advance your pawn another square?") in the next.<br/><br/>Some games also have several methods you can use, to give more or less emphasis to certain conflicts. In Dogs, conflicts that don't escalate are mechanically quicker and less "important" than those that do.

American game-modernism tend to have a mechanically driven action-focus ("Where's the conflict?") that leaves little space for delving into character, other than through the action. In jeep-form and Norwegian style the picture is more mixed.<br/><br/>In classical games (games with a GM) with experienced GMs you often get a mix of scenes; both action- and reflection-focused. The reflective scenes are the ones that allows the players to delve deep into their characters, to experience the magic of strong, intuitive and mutually supportive immersion. This is not due to the classical games actually <i>supporting</i> this, but it is due to their traditional slogan; "You may do anything in this game!" That slogan may be criticized, but it did open up the old classical games for <i>exploration</i>. A lot of GMs and players explored every nook and cranny of setting and story, and ended up discovering the magic of reflective scenes.<br/><br/>I have played <i>Dogs in The Vineyard</i> as one-shots only, and have not seen reflective scenes in it as such. But it do have them in-betweeen-towns in campaign-mode. It is a new classical game, with wonderfully challenging and tight theme, and so I would very much like to try it out in campaign-mode.<br/><br/><i>3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars</i> is a new classical game that mix action and reflection very nicely, by serving up scenes between missions where players may indulge in reflective stances with their characters, evolving relationships in the laid back atmosphere of a holiday-planet. But this is very tight in theme too (so typical for games of today), so you will probably miss the meandering qualities of old in this game, Emily (Have you tried it?). I find this to be one of the most enjoyable new games out there! A breakthrough in classical design!<br/><br/><i><span style="color: #660000;">(edited my comment of Dogs in the Vineyard)</span></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309059/#Comment_309059" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T05:50:17+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  5:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't Dogs mandate reflective scenes between towns?

No?<br/><br/>That said, it is certainly true that a lot of modern games coming from the jeepform school, and some from the indie/modern school (like Flower for Mara, Ribbon Drive, etc) are quite revolutionary in that they actively seek to create those reflective, emotionally-wrought scenes, and provide guidance and tools for that kind of play.<br/><br/>My feeling is that many indie games which are conflict-focused <i>still</i> provide more guidance on "having some slow scenes" (Reflection fallout in Dogs, refreshment scenes in The Shadow of Yesterday, Player Turns in Mouse Guard, etc) than what I remember from "traditional" game texts.<br/><br/>I don't have any of those old game books on hand, though, to pull out some quotes. Maybe the old Player's Handbook did talk about having emotionally powerful scenes and stopping the action, and I just don't remember it? I could be wrong on this one, I admit.

"On the way to talk with the drunk Steward, I'm taking my sister-watchdog aside and sharing my feelings about my cousin's sin, can we play that for a moment, before we put the fear of the lord or the light of the lord into that no-good drunk?"<br/><br/>I think the idea that these scenes don't happen, particularly in an online community is because of the fact that many AP reports do not concentrate on these quiet moments.  Among the many misconceptions about indie RPG's is the one that believes they gleefully careen from one EPIC/AWESOME conflict to another, with players kicking each other in the junk while crying and laughing at the same time, engaging the mechanics at every moment except for bathroom breaks.  That isn't so.<br/><br/>I think what indie RPG's (let's be specific: Dust Devils, Dogs, Sorcerer, BW, AW, TSoY) have done well when it comes to conflicts is talking about the techniques for when to go to the dice and giving the mechanics for giving the results meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Some of them are great games, and all of them make something completely different from the classical game. <i>Prime Time Adventures</i> and <i>Until We Sink ...</i> are my favorites. But I see what you mean; lots of them do tell us to play <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this</span> drama, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> way. If you find that bothersome, you should go classic. On the other hand; if you still find some beauty in the modern games you try, you should keep on trying them, not to find the one and only modern game you can play for the rest of your life, but to get the golden moments buried in them. Some of those moments are hard to find in classical games.<br/><br/>I like classical games too. I have written my share of them; Muu, Fabula, Romanse!, Homuncle, Sirkumdo. I like it when a classical game delivers the very special treat of immersion, in some cases jointly experienced by a whole group in intuitive and free-flowing interaction. I love it when the game surprises us, with turns and quirks none of us is solely responsible for, building a drama that none of us can predict.<br/><br/>I propose for you, algi, to continue your classical training; as a GM and possibly as a designer. The "classical role-playing game" (with GM and players) is still a form to investigate and improve on.

I think there are many gamers here who feel or suspect that in the move from "classical/traditional" play to "modern/indie" play some... some <i>thing</i> has been lost. So it's a discussion that's very interesting, and I suspect that is why it draws so much attention. Is that missing "something" just a youthful sense of nostalgia, an artifact of naive dreaming, and playing on a much longer timescale (the "open-ended campaign"), or is it a feature of design?<br/><br/>I hope you'll continue to post your thoughts on this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13583/my-problem-with-story-or-nar-or-hippie-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13583/my-problem-with-story-or-nar-or-hippie-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13583/my-problem-with-story-or-nar-or-hippie-games/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13583/my-problem-with-story-or-nar-or-hippie-games/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13583/my-problem-with-story-or-nar-or-hippie-games/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13583%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13583%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>My problem with 'story' or 'nar' or 'hippie' games - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13583/my-problem-with-story-or-nar-or-hippie-games/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="My problem with 'story' or 'nar' or 'hippie' games - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13583/my-problem-with-story-or-nar-or-hippie-games/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Paul T.2.

In a D&amp;D/GURPS/Shadowrun/other trad game one-shot, you probably won't see many meandering, reflective scenes. And the book doesn't really you get any, although it doesn't stop you from having them. The game text is focused on revealing and confront the sources of conflict in dungeons.</blockquote>\nYeah!!!!  Something I was thinking about in the light of <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13661&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">the most recent Recess</a>, in fact: not only do many indie games suffer from always being played as one-shots because their overarching structure only becomes evident with repeated sessions, BUT it can become harder to tell the difference between modern and traditionally-structured games in that context as well.<br/><br/>When people sit down to a con one-shot, they tend to be naturally predisposed to focus on a single, compelling situation and resolve it in the space of 4 hours or so.  The characters were likely set up by the GM to be "pointed at each other" in interesting and conflicty ways, or to synergize well in a more cooperative game.  In other words, you get some of the most important features of most indie games no matter what you're playing!  However, to *set up* a good traditional game one-shot takes a lot of work\u2014I hear trad GMs talk about this all the time, in terms of not having time to prep games for cons.  Meanwhile I'm like, "Dude what's your problem?
