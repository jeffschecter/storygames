It's an interesting effort to "storyify" d20 (something near and dear to my heart in light of <a href="http://www.bluedevilgames.com/passages" rel="nofollow">Passages</a>). It's interesting precisely because it's so subtle and moderate, that I think many d20 folks are giving it a spin without even realizing that they are dipping their toes in these kinds of waters. There's been a lot of mention of this effort (along with his equally interesting E6 mod) on the RPGnet d20 forum. And perhaps most interestingly, it seems like Ryan himself has no desire on associating himself or his effort with the S-G community. I might be totally wrong, and I don't know anything about Ryan, but it seems like the idea sprang up entirely organically.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97126/#Comment_97126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T08:01:12+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  8:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin,<br/><br/>I had not seen this!

Hopefully these haven't been hit too much elsewhere, but if they have, the text should be cleaned up to account for the answers to these questions:<br>\n<br>\n - Spending Down Conviction - <br>\nFollowing up on Tim's question, let's do an example. I have 3 conviction in my pool. I raise the death flag, and that gives me 6 more, so I have 9 - breaks the normal limit, but that's allowed. Then, during the combat where I raised the flag, I spend 7 conviction to ensure that I win that contest. So... Now, in order to lower the death flag, I have to come up with a total of 6 conviction... but that can't happen, because the only way I can get to 6 conviction is to raise the death flag again... and it's already up. So I can't raise it again. Right? What am I not understanding? <br/>\n<br/>\n - Spending Conviction, Option 1 - <br/>\nOption number 1 for spending conviction will never be used by a player who is trying to maximize his benefits (usually every player). Because why roll two dice, when I can roll 1 die, see if it's what I need, and then roll another die at need. I might roll a 20, and not need to roll again, in which case, I've burned a conviction for no reason. Why not wait to see the outcome, and then spend the point to roll again if it's insufficient? Same cost, but I only spend it if needed. If you want an option 1 that's interesting, you make it so that the character rolls 3 dice... that way it's a true gamble with a potential payout that's beyond what option 2 can give, but one done blind. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Results of Loss When Death Flag is Down - <br/>\nI'm not fully conversant with the D20 rules... if I'm lowered to 1 HP, do I go unconcsious (in 1st ed it was from 1-10 negative that caused unconsciousness)? What I'm getting at is that with the Death Flag not raised, if I'm reduced to 1 HP, do I get to fight on? If so... why ever raise the death flag? I can't lose if I don't. If, on the other hand, I fall unconscious, then I'm losing the contest in a way. The bad guys get away or something. This still leaves questions about what happens in certain situations. Let's say that I'm being attacked by hungry lions... if I fall unconscious, will they not then follow up and kill and eat me? Basically you have two cases for what must happen when the death flag is not up, and a character would otherwise die:<br/>\n<br/>\nA) The character can just fight on at 1HP. This is kinda lame. Basically, unless the player raises the death flag, he's never really risking anything... he doesn't even have to take the time to heal up, he can just fight the next fight at 1HP, and never take any damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nB) The character goes unconscious or otherwise loses the fight. In this case the character may well be killed anyhow, if the DM is allowed to just have the opposition kill them off after they've won the fight. So the only case in which the death flag being lowered doesn't still result in chracter death are those in which the party wins overall, saving the downed characters (Characters only die on a TPK), or where the DM decides to have mercy on the down PCs, and comes up with a rationale for why they aren't killed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution to this problem in "dirty hippie" games is that the character going below zero doesn't fall unconscious or such, but that the agreement is that the character fails somehow but does not die, and the DM has to come up with a plausible explanation for how this happens. This can range from the combat being cut short by forces beyond anyone's control (the characters are separated by a chasm that opens up from an earthquake, or whatever), to the victorious bad guys coming up with a scheme as to why the capture the PCs (the lions are charmed servants of a local druid, and they bring the unconscious PCs to said druid who demands that they perform some task for them). Or any other explanation you want to come up with. Perhaps the two opponents back off from each other, and, impressed incredibly with each other's prowess, simply bow to each other, and walk away. Whatever is cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally losing with the death flag down should still be some sort of loss... there still must be stakes. The stakes just aren't death. If you can't identify what these stakes are before the combat, then you shouldn't have the combat at all, or you must require the players to raise the death flag to get into the combat. What you should ask yourself with each combat is why the combat is happening? Do the PCs need to make it to the next room? Then that's what's at stake, and losing means they run off perhaps, and have to find another way in. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be surprised if you don't encounter problems that people have had using your system, not understanding what to describe in the situation where loss occurs. Sure, with the extra conviction, it's probably rare. But you have to account for those rare cases where it will happen. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Stakes, Stakes, Stakes - <br/>\nRaising the stakes, interestingly, is simply what we'd call "setting the stakes" and what the games we play around here tend to have as a presumption from the start. That is, D&amp;D says that the default is "fight until death." And you're giving alternatives. In the games we play, deciding that the stakes are "fight until death" is part of the same process that produces the sorts of results you imply in "raising the stakes." That is, I'm as likely to make the stakes "Run off if you fail, having to find another way in" as I am to make them "If you fail, you die." Actually I'm probably far more likely to make them the former than the latter, as the "Death flag" in these games only gets raised when there's something so worthwhile on the line that the player is fully willing to have the story of their character end here, either way. So, likely only once in a campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued below...                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98079/#Comment_98079" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T07:03:19+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  7:03AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...continued from above.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Player Understanding of Stakes - <br/>\nIf players understand about stakes, an interesting thing happens. You can be "mean" to them. Rather, you can't possibly be mean to them, so you can be "unfair." That is, right now you still have to worry a lot about setting appropriate CRs, right? I note that you spend some time on the enworld site talking about how many feats equals how many levels, and how to make good encounters because of this, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, what if you didn't have to bother? What if you could present the PCs with dragons at first level, and not worry? I mean yeah, the chances of winning such a combat are slim and none. But if the death flag doesn't go up, then the real question is what's at stake losing to the dragon. And you can make up all sorts of interesting stakes. And what's interesting here is that you are allowing the players a chance to kill a dragon at first level - even if that chance is minute. Something that simply would never happen in play with the normal system because players would avoid it at all costs (or call you a bad GM for throwing it at them at such a low level if/when their characters died). Using this system, you can simply throw at them whatever you think is fun to throw at them, whenever you want. That logic could be "Whatever is there on the map" or "whatever is dramatic." But what you don't have to do is to have the world modify itself to become appropriately dangerous in it's environs to the PCs power levels. Which is something that I, at least, always found to be BS. The PCs always seemed to carry a "Danger Level Bubble" around with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis allows the players, too, to take control of their character's destinies. Is it crazy to go looking for that dragon? Sure, but people do crazy things. The players can feel free to have their characters behave like normal humans, with all of their flaws, because they know that they won't suffer the only real player penalty that a game can deliver... elimination from ability to play a character, through that characters's death (or something else that makes it unplayable). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, congratulations, you've cracked that nut here. But I think you have a step to go until players understand the ramifications, and you get the full benefits of what you've wrought. The players need to understand what, in fact, is at stake when they go up against something against which they're not going to raise the death flag. No, they don't need to understand the specifics neccessarily. They just have to understand the sort of thing that's likely to be the outcome. Imprisonment, disfigurement, being forced to go somewhere they don't want to go, being unable to get something that they want, etc, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of what I'm talking about here I've encapsulated in this essay here: http://www.glorantha.com/support/na_defeat.html<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's written for Hero Quest RPG, but I think you'll find that it pertains to what you're striving for as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98095/#Comment_98095" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T08:14:01+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  8:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not the author, but from my first reading of this and D20:<br/><br/>a) The death flag remains raised until you buy it down, so if you don't have the conviction to do that you're remaining in danger. Since you get new conviction at the start of a new session, you can probably buy it down then.<br/><br/>b) Rerolling costs 2 points of conviction while rolling two dice costs 1 point, so it is not as clear-cut a better alternative as you propose <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>c) You fall to -9HP when the death flag is down, because death in D20 is at -10HP and you get within 1 HP of death.

Why should I raise it during the first fight of night? Then I would be stuck with the flag up the entire time (assuming I spend 6 conviction---and why would I raise the flag if I didn't plan on spending a ton of conviction?). Furthermore, if I raise the flag during the middle of the adventure, that means I have to give up my conviction points later (next session) in order to lower it again.<br/><br/>Is this an accurate prediction? Does this happen in play, in your experience?<br/><br/>This "dirty hippie" thinks it would be cool if the flag went down on its own (somehow). That would grant the players more freedom in deciding what conflicts/combats they thought were important. As-is, if a player wants to raise the flag, they have to consider how it will effect future play. Potentially, that might discourage them from raising the flag in conflicts/combats they otherwise would.<br/><br/>For example, let's say that at the start of adventure, the party is returning to one of the character's home town. As they approach, they see the town is under attack by a group of thieves/mercenaries. The GM doesn't intend this to be a major battle, and it only involves low-level enemies. But it totally infuriates the player who's returning home. He wants to make a point, he wants to raise the flag and whop a ton of ass to show that no one messes with his home town. As-is, the player (I imagine) might feel discouraged from doing this, as that would mean the flag would have to stay up all during the Dark Forest and the thieves hideout, etc.<br/><br/>I understand that you don't want players simply raising it all the time, 'cause they can get extra conviction... that does pose a problem... I'm not sure, off-hand, how to keep that from happening.<br/><br/>My initial reaction is to say that conflicts/combats should always be "deadly", meaning, there's always a good possibility that players may "die"/lose. Then, players will have to make a hard call whether or not to raise the flag, since the risk would be real. But that might make play in general difficult. Another option might be to grant some sort of conviction-like resource to the GM whenever the flag is raised. Then conflicts/combats with the flag raised would be automatically harder. But that might discourage raising the flag at all... Another possible "fix" would be to say that any un-used Flag-Conviction disappears after the conflict/combat. (So like, if you had 3 conviction before the fight, you raise the flag and go up to 9. If you only spend 4 points, your conviction drops back to 3 afterwards.) That  would at least keep players form racking up a ton of Conviction. And if they continually raise the flag, they run the risk of getting killed.<br/><br/>Anyway, just thoughts, take them with a grain of salt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

So, yes, at the beginning of the next session one can lower the death flag... but, basically, unless you don't spend points down below 6... in which case, why raise the death flag... you're going to be stuck with the death flag raised throughout the rest of the current session. And then you'll have either no conviction in the next session (if you lower the flag), or be stuck until the beginning of the next session with it up. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot a lot of options there. Like Tim says, lots of people waiting until the end of sessions. Drama considerations notwithstanding. <br/>\n<br/>\n - I thought those were numbered option, not costs, for the spending options for Conviction. I see now. That does balance. Can somebody tell me if an attack is a "Standard Option" or a "Movement option" (I would guess the former). Can two of these options be taken in the same turn? I'd think so, but the text is explicit about the re-roll option being allowed multiple times. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Why say 1 more than death, and not -9 HP, then? Is there some variability in this figure? Yes, Christian, it's not hard to figure out something that happens. But what I'm saying is that the text should be explicit that something else does happen, and that the GM is strictly forced to make that happen and not have the character be subsequently killed (as would seem likely in many situations where the character was unconcsious). It's a metagame agreement about what's at stake, and that should be clear. The mechanics don't, by themselves, do this. <br/>\n<br/>\n - I like Justin's and Tim's ideas for lowering the flag. First, the flag should go down immediately after the battle. This is good not only for the reason Tim cited (players can consider only this fight and it's stakes in terms of whether or not they raise the flag), but it also means that there are more opportunities for the player to have to decide whether or not to raise the flag. Which sounds like good fun to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we enusre that the amount of conviction doesn't just climb? Tim's method is one way. But odds are, I'd think, that if the death flag is up, that players will be burning through their conviction to stay alive. I'm betting there won't be huge surplusses in most cases. I mean... why take the maneuver to get the conviction, if you're not then going to spend it. So you could ignore this "problem" entirely. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, you could just lower the refresh rate to one or two per session... then the only way to really get conviction up would be to raise the death flag once in a while, and to not spend all six. In any case, they've "paid" for that conviction they got with the risk that they've taken. There doesn't need to be any more payment, IMO. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's an even better idea for how players should get back conviction, rather than a refresh rate. Each player should specify three "Beliefs" for their character. When their character takes an action that shows that belief in action, they get a conviction point (the player can claim it, GM approves). Once per session, the character can change one of their beliefs, and in doing so, gets a conviction point. This change in belief must, of course, stem from something in play and have GM approval as such. <br/>\n<br/>\nActing against a belief may result in the GM taking away a conviction point. Obviously your character doesn't believe so strongly in what he thought were his beliefs. So if you're going to act against a belief, consider this a good point to potentially change that belief. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, risking one's life simply counts as 6 "actions" that show the character's belief. If the action doesn't follow the character's belief, then he cannot raise the death flag - but the player may change his belief on the spot to make it possible using up his one change for the session. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis, then, incorporates Burning Wheel Beliefs/TSOY Keys into this system. Which sounds pretty cool to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98147/#Comment_98147" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T10:28:11+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 10:28AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2007 10:33AM by Burr.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool idea with the Beliefs.  Another (or an additional) possibility would be to allow Conviction Debt.  The death flag gets lowered immediately after combat; and the character immediately loses 6 conviction, even if that brings him below 0.  Then the character could escape debt or simply raise his Conviction by any of the possibilities previously mentioned.  <br/><br/>*Addendum: A character in debt would not be able to raise his death flag, because he isn't convicted enough to stake his life on anything at the moment.  One could say the character is physically, mentally, or emotionally exhausted.

The real payoff is Raise Stakes on what you're going to accomplish and then spend madly (both to succeed and avoid the negative outcome negotiated for failing).<br/><br/>Ryan should probably weigh in on the "refresh after 4 hours", our play sessions are more like 3 in practice.<br/><br/>The "raised death flag for cool meaningful fight and then died in meaningless event a bit later before refresh" thing hasn't come up in games I've played.  In those, with Ryan DM'ing using E6 and Raising Stakes I think no one has raised death flag.  We're playing the "formative period" of the characters in away.<br/><br/>Even if they had, the "most meaningful" fights tend to come "at the end of session", when a refresh would follow.  E.G., the longest running time between refreshes was a period of thematically linked scenes on same day, roughly 2 minor ones no one would raise a DF over that were the 'start of something', one more significant one that was 'it's starting to really come down now' that still wasn't hitting anything personal enough to Death Flag, and then the "oh crap, this is what it's all about" that was just on edge of DF material depending on your character but didn't end up calling for it (e.g., I was out of conviction and most everything else by the end of that, would so wanted to have spent like mad to stop that NPC getting away but c'est la vie, the thing about recurring villains is you know you'll get another shot at them).<br/><br/>I'm all for Beliefs (I love BW, got into Ryan's group actually through the local indie scene while looking for a BW group), and it's not that hard to see Belief artha turned into Conviction.  It is about a different design objective though, Conviction is not connected to expressing anything about character except coolness ~ in keeping with the E6 d20 hack it's gamist in its current incarnation.  I'm toying with a self-imposed rule on that front for my own character but it's more about "spend only when belief relevant" not "earn through belief".  I already know that I would only Death Flag on a Belief-like issue for me as a character, not sure about other players.<br/><br/>For me, it's just always seemed natural, "I've done my cool stuff, I'll play in my limits and let someone else shine now".   It stops someone who's adept at game (e.g., designing Beliefs that crank out the rewards) from overshadowing.  We have a very wide range of d20 play experience at the table (the widest possible actually).<br/><br/>I think a system that saw Beliefs earn would work better with equal levels of player familiarity with system (or lots of coaching on designing them if recipients okay with that).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98165/#Comment_98165" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T11:07:02+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 11:07AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Ryan, for your reference, just so you know what the hell Mike is talking about, here's a d20 hack of The Shadow of Yesterday's (TSoY) Keys system: <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/experience.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98167/#Comment_98167" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T11:10:02+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 11:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Valvorik, thanks for the answers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98180/#Comment_98180" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T12:06:46+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 12:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Valvorik = Rob<br/>\n<br/>\nRob,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the comments. Very interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that piques my interest is the fact that nobody has found it neccessary to raise the death flag. Let me ask you this question: how many battles have your characters lost? <br/>\n<br/>\nI find it ironic that, supposedly, the CR system provides a level of conflict that's "challenging" for the PCs to overcome. I say Supposedly, because how many D&amp;D conflicts actually are lost in play? If "challenging" means even about a 25% chance of failure, the odds of winning ten combats in a row become less than 6%. In practice most D&amp;D combats have to be ameliorated to create a chance more like only 1% chance of failure... or 0 by fudging... in order for the sorts of success you see in actual D&amp;D play. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it could be the case that good ole Ryan is taking it easy on you... so tell me... how many combats have you actually lost? Where the rule that you go to "all but one HP" had to kick in? <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of two very interesting things is true:<br/>\n1. Ryan is taking it easy on you, because he still doesn't buy that character defeat is fun, even if it doesn't mean that you have to lose your characters. Or, perhaps, he's afraid of what he has to do if/when this comes up, in terms of rationalizing how you escape alive. In this case, the system hasn't really been playtested, it's just been avoided. You haven't had to raise the death flag, then, because there's never been a need to do so. You always win anyhow. <br/>\n2. Ryan isn't taking it easy on you, and you've gone to -9 HP a few times. What's fascinating in this case is, if it's true, it means that all of those people who claim that taking death off the line makes combat non-fun, are wrong, wrong, wrong. I mean you've NEVER raised the death flag? That means that it's been your considered opinion in every case that it would be more fun to play the combat "to the unconsciousness" than it would be to play "to the death" if death means losing your character. Let me ask another question, then, did you understand what would happen if you failed? Were there repercussions when it happened? If so, what were they? How did it play out?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this system has actually been playtested, then I want to hear actual play accounts of it's use. Because the results are about as interesting a set of data as I can imagine. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98208/#Comment_98208" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T13:46:45+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  1:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2007 1:47PM by Valvorik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're "sampling levels" on our way to really testing E6 when we hit 6th+, so in meantime getting hang of Raising the Stakes, developing setting and party etc.<br/><br/>I would say (gulp, do I now bring invite pain on my poor cleric), he's been taking it easy on us so far.  Big caveat, that is this group and he's run it before with others several times and when he surfaces from the madness of work can probably relate experiences with other playtests.<br/><br/>I think in one encounter someone went down (oh brave 1st level halfing rogue who ran to take ahold of the chain on the bear and try to restrain him from running amok among the kiddies, rogue and sticky fingered and questionable that you are to my ethical cleric, your courage in that moment has forever put a halo around you in his eyes) but I don't think he got to -9.  In another we could easily have ended up facing an overwhelming # of mooks and I think it was "worked out okay for campaign if we ended up prisoners etc." because the safety net meant we probably wouldn't die.  We would then (in terms of repurcussions) have been prisoners of foreign invaders in league with corrupt local faction that might be in service of something much worse that (we are learning) likes to replace people with facsimiles (involving a process of having the original "eaten").  I suspect we might have then faced a more "dire scenario".<br/><br/>So in that sense, having hit the "would be dead now" but not be line, it hasn't had an effect.  I think it has had the effect in play that we play "over the top heroes" a bit more than we might otherwise, playing a bit more "what would my character do" rather than "what are the odds on this?"  The first level halfling running up to restrain the raging bear probably being a good example of that.<br/><br/>As I've said, for me, I would only "raise the death flag" in a situation where I feel my character would literally be thinking "this is worth my life" ~ now for my character that would include lives of comrades who have impressed him such as aforementioned halfling, the noble family that paid for his training as a cleric and that he now serves, any faith-critical issue, several NPC's he's close to, putting a stop to the "facscimile threat" since it appears quite pernicious and almost took a friend of mine etc.  I think in a "death flag" game a character should have a healthy (unhealhty?) list of things they're willing to die for.  Encouraging "what would you die for" thoughts rather than the (apparently more simply answered) "what would you kill for" is a useful exercise.<br/><br/>In a story sense, I would not raise the flag because "this looks like a situation it's hard to explain surviving" if none of those personal factors were at stake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98237/#Comment_98237" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T17:56:18+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  5:56PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob/Valvorik pretty much has me figured out, although I was really curious what it would have looked like if the PCs had been the first early prisoners of the coup.

I think the very earliest inklings came from my experiences with the Dragonlance Saga (card-based) RPG.  In that game, the passage of high cards into each player's hand gets that player thinking about what their character can do, and in that way it shared the spotlight quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI focus a great deal on sharing the spotlight for a few reasons.  The biggest one is the very real difference in the approaches of my players.  I have frequently had the experience, as a player, of "taking over the game" - I'm pretty good at roleplaying and I dig deep into my GM's world.  I also bend over backwards to make a session (I can hear Rob yelling "Liar!" what with the current hiatus) so I can be depended on if you start having a game's plot revolve around my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this is really great for the GM and me, but everybody else is bored - or at least, less engaged than if they were the ones with the spotlight.  I've also got a range of playstyles at my table to manage.  In particular, my main man R\xc3\xa9mi (10 year veteran of my games) is more of a quiet guy.  When we played 7th sea (which has lots of rewards built in but are based on the DM getting 'wowed') R\xc3\xa9mi was essentially punished for not being talkative.  He isn't the type of guy to shout overtop of someone else (my old group has a few adult ADHD kind of fellows, who are great but sometimes drown Remi out), so sometimes even a regular game of D&amp;D; he can seem to be being "carried along" even though he's the big deciding force when it comes to what the group of PCs ultimately does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why Conviction is all about sharing the spotlight.  Even if we have bombastic, exciting guys roleplaying to the amusement of all, once they've used their Conviction it's time for guys like R\xc3\xa9mi, or Terence (new to RPGs altogether) to have the limelight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Conviction is about sharing power interpersonally, I don't tie it to game days anymore (I used to).  6 per 4 hour session tends to be just about perfect... for a 4 hour session.  Since our games have been a little shorter, I find that there might be too many points out there.  I'd rather deal with that by making slightly longer sessions, though, instead of reducing the Conviction payout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98330/#Comment_98330" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T13:57:31+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  1:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>How do we enusre that the amount of conviction doesn't just climb?</blockquote>Make 'em temporary points, of course!

What I'd consider, though, is making the "buy down" cost less than the number of points you'd get out of the flag. Like, say you get 6 conviction and it costs 4 or 5 to buy down the death flag -- "spotlight sharing" is still in effect, but you basically got a free point or two to compensate you for the risk. I'd like to know, Ryan, if you've thought about that approach and what pros/cons you see in it.<br><br>I could also see the death flag as a specialized "raising the stakes" tool rather than a spotlight-control tool. This seems to be the approach of most of the folks commenting on it. In that case, I'd make it change the costs of things rather than give you points: risk your life and your conviction does more for you, so to speak. I think you've got plenty of tools for "raising the stakes" in there already, and I don't see a reason why character death can't be on the line when you invoke the actual stake-raising rules (I can do something like "Okay, if I successfully seduce her, she renounces the throne, but if I fail, she murders me as an example" and circumvent the usual no-death rule that way, too, right?).<br><br>-- Alex                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98356/#Comment_98356" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T19:20:40+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  7:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my thoughts:<br><br>I worry that the automatic success action imbalances things a lot towards magic-using classes. I mean, a fighty-type can use two conviction to automatically hit. But even at low levels, a magic user could automatically succeed on the magic check for, say, Sleep or Color Spray, and win the fight. Let alone, as you get higher in levels, suggestion, baleful polymorph, finger of death, etc.<br><br>To be fair, this is an existing imbalance that the system just highlights, rather than creates. (Spellcasters get more awesome per action than non-spellcasters do, in general) I still might consider something like, if you do a full attack action, any conviction spent applies to every attack in that sequence, or something like that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98360/#Comment_98360" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T19:40:02+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  7:40PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Automatic success?

The character has, with raising the death flag, made a statement about what's important to them.  If they proceed to die sometime afterwards, even if it's not the same gunfight, they've still made a statement about what's worth dying for.  I've seen this several times in film: The hero saves the day then rides off and either succumbs to his wounds or meets some less-important-seeming end - but it's not ignoble, because it follows on the pivotal scene where the hero <i>does</i> stake his life for something.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor interpersonal reasons relating to the idea of a session as an episode and the level of engagement when players just watched another player make that commitment, I want the player to have the option to lower the death flag as the next session starts.  Now, if the next session starts and the player chooses not to spend the 6 Conviction, they're embracing a kind of fatalism for their character, and that's fine too - that's a viable player choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, and this should be explicit in the next version of the rules (I need to keep notes somewhere, oi... I've got a baby on the way so my projects are in chaos) - any Conviction you have left at the end of a session can be spent to pay down your Death Flag.  So if you raised your Death flag and ended up with 2 points unspent, you only need 4 more next session - because you didn't make full use of your extra spotlight power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98365/#Comment_98365" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T20:16:37+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  8:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2007 8:18PM by Ry.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here's the skinny on the Death Flag:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found in many d20 campaigns (and the many others that follow the d20 formula) that death is a very, very weak point in the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, the biggest challenge for the DM from a system point of view is bringing in just enough opposition to get the players worried about the death mechanic without actually causing death.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen death comes up in d20 campaigns, there's an unspoken "man, this sucks" around the table.  The player loses the character that they've been trying for ages to roleplay and develop and generally everyone's dissatisfied.  So the natural reaction is that the DM fudges death away behind his screen (I'm not a screen man, btw).  A pretty common approach (which I've seen in many games and many house rule discussions online) is to make death harder and harder but still possible.  This might include, having that -10 "death barrier" extended, sometimes with level, or allow a "death save" and so on.  But to me the real issue is that if neither the players nor the DM want a player character to die in a scene, then why shouldn't the rules reflect that?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's not to say that death isn't on the table.  I have had an occasions where player-character death was essential to the story, and that death was something both I and the player basically saw eye to eye on.  Honestly, I think that with the character being something the player puts so much effort into, it should be the player determining when the stakes are "I won't be able to play this character anymore."  Since death stakes are exciting and rewarding for me as a GM, I provided the Conviction boost as an added incentive to make setting those stakes appealing on a game level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98373/#Comment_98373" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T21:00:22+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  9:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2007 6:37AM by Ry.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I find it ironic that, supposedly, the CR system provides a level of conflict that's "challenging" for the PCs to overcome.

If "challenging" means even about a 25% chance of failure, the odds of winning ten combats in a row become less than 6%. In practice most D&amp;D combats have to be ameliorated to create a chance more like only 1% chance of failure... or 0 by fudging... in order for the sorts of success you see in actual D&amp;D play.</blockquote>\nThe CR system isn't designed to create a 25% chance of failure; it's designed to have 1 encounter take 25% of the party's rechargeable resources, including hit points, spells, and so on.  The idea is that the party makes it through 4 encounters a day <i>and then has to rest</i>.  So the party is supposed to survive really everything if they control the situation or bite off only about 4 encounters per day (this is changing in 4e but that's beside the point).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98414/#Comment_98414" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T07:16:55+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  7:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2007 7:19AM by Valvorik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike might have been transporting to the CR system other comments WOTC designers have made about d20, that players are expected to succeed 75% of the time ~ recommended Skill DC's are based on that math.  Very apt for Gamist play of action story (Conan or John McCain has that or better success at a task level).<br><br>On the encounter front, WOTC's adventure design advice recommended that of what would be 7 combats in an entire adventure, one would be with overwhelming foe where issue was really to avoid combat (4 regular fights, 1 mook fight, 1 climax fight, 1 overpowering dude, then other encounters testing skills etc. to come up to 16 total).  So only really 1/7 an expected loss and point to avoid it.<br><br>Where this comes back to topic of Death Flag, one thing I like about the Death Flag is it takes the "dead hand of cannot let party fail any middling+ encounter because that means the trauma of 1+ deaths" off the GM (of course they're not all dead if they lose this fight and I didn't hand waive it, see it's in the rules) opening up the vista of "but you did fail and man I'm gonna **** you over now and you can see how really I have to in order to keep any kind of believability going, don't you" (and I'm not being an SOB, that's what the story demands, don't whine, at least you're not dead).  The range of stories opens up wider.  It's lets the GM frame more believable scenarios instead of always having "level appropriate training wheels" on regardless of where the story has gone, which is more apt the more you are sliding into protagonist/story now play guided by PC choices.<br><br>Rob                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98425/#Comment_98425" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T09:40:08+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  9:40AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brilliant, just brilliant. <br><br>But I do have one question: Did I miss something or does the PDF explain somewhere why 12 is the number you always add to an antagonists roll?

Sure, In an equal CR fight there's not much chance of the PCs biting it until maybe the 4th and final fight before resting. But what if you just upped the CR ante? Like, instead of taking CR 4 as the baseline for level 4 party encounters, make it CR 6 (with the usual range of "some lower, some higher, a few MUCH higher").

I think you've got something really worthwhile here, and I'm trying to help out. I hope that something comes out of our discussion here. <br>\n<br/>\nAs for you goals... I'm glad that you have put them out here. To be truthful, I think that most people here will implicitly understand your goals for this system... it's exactly what "story-games" are all about. The designs we tend to play here, for example, would not even have death as an automatic stake in most cases. These games are even "post-combat" in that they don't reject the idea of combat being the central form of resolution for RPG play, but that they start from a basis of considering what the game is "about" from the get go. Meaning that it would only ever have death as stakes if the particular design demanded it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that's not to say that your design is inferior, you're very explicitly trying to create a fix for a game that you still otherwise want to play. But the point is that I doubt that you have to explain yourself to many here. That said, again, it's good that you've done so for any non-natives that come by. And... I love that you've done so, because it's a sort of vindication for us to find that there are more like us, even amongst the ranks of D&amp;D players. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Like us" here meaning people who would alter the system of D&amp;D to get the sort of play which they're looking for. Many of us started from precisely the same place - I certainly did. I have to admit that I gave up on D&amp;D in about 1981, and have been trying to design a better moustrap every since. For the first two decades of that effort, I couldn't have told you why it was that I didn't like what D&amp;D promoted, however. It's only in the past five years that it's become clearer what the real differences in play-styles are about. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo congratulations on having, on your own apparently, come up with a relatively clear statement of the problem... to say nothing of your solution. That's quite brilliant. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to brass tacks, let's talk about the benefits of the system:<br/>\nThe 25% figure - I made that up off the top of my head. If it matches figures thrown about by WotC or other designers or whatever... purely by coincidence. I picked that figure, because it's conservative. I mean, what I thought that the CR system was intended to achieve was, in fact, parity. Meaning that the monsters have about a 50% chance to win. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we all know that such a figure is absurd. It would result in death far, far too often, even for relatively hardcore play... I mean how can you guage ongoing success if your character is dying every other combat. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you're correct. The system in D&amp;D is interesting in that it's designed to drain so much of your resources. What this means, however, is that play becomes this odd game where the main tactical decision is "do we push for another encounter today?" Which is odd, since how often is it that the answer can't be to pull back? I mean, yeah, it's possible to engineer a situation in which time pressure exists to get a job done quickly. But how often is that actually the case? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've usually observed is that it's typically a case of bravado. The question usually becomes something like, "How far do we push our characters today, to prove how tough they are, and how willing we are to take risks?" Beacause... well... the real risk of character death comes at that 4th encounter of the day, right? Where the resources are running thin. And if you push for a fifth, well, the previous four were hopefully relatively easy on your resources, or you're in real trouble, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice a group, if it wants to be safe, can simply recharge after each and ever encounter. Which means, if they do, that you never have any real threat. The "loss" is where more than 25% of resources were burnt to win. Or where non-rechargable resources that the group have are burnt, and the rewards for the contest did not replenish them (you had to resort to the precious healing potions). You only tend to get characters in danger here if they do things that are tactically very unsound, like the great example given above of the halfling risking his neck. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is all exactly what I'm talking about. What if, instead of each combat being made into a sure thing that's designed only to drain X% of your resources... what if many (heck all of them, if you like) could result in 100% resource drain and the characters losing? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you made the contests actually even odds? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you made it actually likely that the characters would lose? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, you can't do this in D&amp;D normally. As we've said, it would result in characters dying so often. Which is why the actual percentage chance of death is so low in D&amp;D encounters as designed. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in your system, the characters don't die if they lose. Something else bad happens instead. So you're now free to throw whatever you like at your PCs. I'll say that again, you can throw whatever you like at them. Just ignore the CRs altogether if you like. But, in any case, jack up the level in some cases so that you get truely heroic fights... that is ones in which there's no garuntee of success, or even likelihood neccessarily. "Heroism" is all to do with characters diving in heedless of the consequences, because they know that the goal must be persued. <br/>\n<br/>\nAllow your players to have their chracters act that heroically - give them situations where diving in is truely likely to result in failure. Because:<br/>\n1) They might win. And then how cool is that? That they managed to defeat foes equal to themselves, or even thought to be tougher. <br/>\n2) Even if the characters lose, the players win. Did you read my essay? Given a situation with the death flag down, what this means is that the player is risking something other than death. And if they lose, that simply means that they now have more trouble in their lives to deal with. The character becomes more interesting to play. Now we have to chase down the bad guy who got away. Or escape from imprisonment. Or deal with the curse that we've been put under, or... well you get the idea. <br/>\n3) You finally get to really test your players... that is you, as DM, now can play the opposition all out trying to win. Because you know that if you do win, you don't have to feel guilty that you caused the death of a PC - beacuse you won't. You will, instead, come up with some loss condition that will make the PC more fun to play (see 2 above). So you can try to win combats with all of the resources you have at hand, and do not have to take it easy on the PCs. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote, again, how there are subtle DM tricks that people use to keep PCs alive. Yeah, you roll the dice on the table... that's great. But that doesn't mean that you don't sometimes make tactically unsound choices. What is, in D&amp;D, the most important tactical choice? Who to attack, right? The players, being smart, will always attack the wizbang first. Why? For the same reason that my gnome mage is always getting killed in WOW... the "aggro" calculaton is simple. What's the highest damage output to Hit Points ratio? That would be the wizard, yup. Putting him down is easiest, and results in the most threat reduction. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore below...                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98555/#Comment_98555" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T07:03:32+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  7:03AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...Continued from above. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd not only do you attack the wizard, but you all attack the wizard. That is, you don't split up your attacks on different targets. Because it's important to incapacitate enemy attacks. You do that by eliminating them one at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs DM, if you want to drain 25% of resources against 4 characters, you have each of your foes attack one of the PCs. Because if you used the ganging up tactic, you might be able to get one PC down 100%. So, to some extent, the DM does have control over the outcome in terms of how well he employs tactics (or intentionally fails to do so). <br/>\n<br/>\nWith your system you no longer have to hold back on the challenge, you can employ the best tactics available, and really challenge the players' abilities. It's what Joel is talking about... you can raise the level of challenge considerably. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more reason that this is good. It means that death flag will be reinforced as being only for the right circumstance. It means that it's not raised just to get a boost to win a contest. It means that, if it's raised, the player understands that he really and truely is, in fact, risking his character's life. Which makes the situation all the more dramatic if and where it occurs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have some other topics in a post to follow,<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98566/#Comment_98566" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T07:39:22+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  7:39AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Cost of the Death Flag<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue that I have with the cost of lowering the Death Flag is that it sets up an arbitrary length for which the flag stays up. That is, if I raise it at the beginning of a session, it'll last all session. If I raise it at the end of the session, it might only last for that encounter. What this means is that the player will consider the positioning of the encounter in terms of when it's occuring in the session, in terms of deciding to raise the flag or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nIsn't that an oddly artificial criteria for the player to consider? <br/>\n<br/>\nI like your notions about fatalism... I agree with you that a player should be allowed to keep the flag up for a while (or even indefinitely). But the consideration of when to do this or not shouldn't have anything to do with the positioning of the event in the session. It should be all about character motives, and player desire to create theme, shouldn't it? Put another way, we wouldn't want a player to not raise the death flag solely because he didn't want to keep it up for more than the current encounter and would be forced to mechanically if he did, right? It's going to be rare enough as it is, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I'm really for is coming up with other ways for the player to get the conviction he needs to "pay it off" or some other thing he can do to lower the flag immediately. And I think that comes down to haveing a better way to dole out conviction in the first place, other than a session-based reward. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this is an opportunity for you. All reward systems have two elements: you have the second part well designed, which is what the reward does. But you're first part, what the reward is given for, is, apparently, for just showing up to play. What we sometimes call "attendance rewards". That's a misnomer, however, because the players have to show up just to play (the play is it's own reward for showing up), and they won't actually miss out on accumulating points if they don't show up. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, it's no reward at all, what you have. It's simply "fuel" for the system you've put in place. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich isn't terrible, lots of systems do this. It's just that you have an opportunity to come up with something you want to reward in play, some behavior you want to incentivize, and give out the points for that. The most powerful reward systems work together on both ends. Consider EXP... you get them for killing, etc, and so that's what people do. Then you can spend them to get better at XYZ, and so that's what people do, too. The circle is complete there. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider finding some sort of action that you can reward the players for with conviction points. This will then incentivize that behavior, and it also means that, potentially, a player can work off his raised death flag in the middle of play and not have to worry about where in the session the encounter occurs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to reiterate something, because I think it's gotten lost here. A key to your system, especially if you do as I say above, and make failure a relatively common occurance, is that you have to have failure stakes set. That is, sure, death is off the table here, but you have to have something on the table. Or failures will seem hollow. Failure must have some "Bite" to it, or players will feel that any contest without the death flag raised is not a real conflict. As Rob says above, this opens new vistas of play. The result of a combat loss might be, for instance, some sort of maiming of the character. He might lose an eye. Or the respect of a good woman. Or... well anything. Be creative here, and make failure painful to the character. Because failures painful to the character, make the character more interesting for the player to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother note here, however... you aptly discern the real problem with character death as it being about an inability to play the character any longer. Here's an important thing to consider when setting stakes other than death... there are other conditions than character death that can make it so that a player may find the character unsuitable to continue playing. These aren't always easy to see, either. But, for instance, it could be that a player might find a character who has lost a leg to be uninteresting to play further. Some players might relish the challenge that this presents. But other players may have a vision of thier character that precludes being peg-legged, or running off to find somebody who can reattach their limb. This sort of loss may be akin to character death, in that the character will now be "ruined" for the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially avoid stakes that are degrading to the PC, unless you're certain that the player wants this sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry to do this determination without too much dicsussion, if you can... it makes it more suspenseful if the players don't know what the outcome result of a loss in combat will be. But, that said, if you're not sure about a particular failure condition that you want to inflict on the PCs, you have one way to be absolutely sure that they'll like that failure result...<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk them. In fact, allow them to veto any particular result that really rankles with them. Ask them to come up with another equivalent, but more palatable failure. Instead of the character grovelling before the evil overlord, he resists to the end and the overlord kills his pet parrot instead, before sending the PC off to the salt mines. Oh now how sweet will the revenge be on that evil overlord when the character escapes, obtains the Sword of Justice, and uses it to run the evil overlord through!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that imprisonment is an interesting case. If you freeze Han Solo in carbonite, you do, in fact, take away the player's ability to play the character until he's thawed. So here's the key with all imprisonments... you have to still have something for the players to do. If they're in prison, then you either have to run prision dramas (which are fun), or you have to allow the escape attempt/rescue scenario. If, in fact, you've got the character frozen in carbonite, you have to then frame right to the rescue... else you're punishing the player for their loss until you do. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood scene-framing technique comes in handy here. Skip to the important stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98677/#Comment_98677" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T11:32:39+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 11:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I mean, yeah, it's possible to engineer a situation in which time pressure exists to get a job done quickly.

If you push your luck and stick around for another encounter, you're actually risking getting into an unknown number of extra encounters before and after the one you planned. So when you decide to rest and renew your resources you're either risking a surprise attack in the dungeon or a surprise attack on the way back to town -- sometimes both. This is one of my favorite classic D&amp;D rules, and it almost perfectly represents the factor known as "friction" in warfighting.<br/><br/>A lot of people hate random encounters and immediately ditch them, but when you do, you seriously break the resource management game, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98683/#Comment_98683" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T11:57:09+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 11:57AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 12:05PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited, because I thought I disagreed with Jon, and I don't]<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't see how that's a nitpick, John, when I can only most heartily agree. <br/>\n<br/>\nA ton of metagaming goes on here, note.

Like, the "I lose an eye" flag, or the "I run away" flag.  Obviously, there are an infinite number of potential flags.  But you already have a mechanic to handle it.  The player says "I'll raise a "Lose an Eye" flag for three Conviction".  The GM says "deal" or "no bet".  This enables really personal flags, like "I give up my vows", as well as party stakes like "we run out of time" (the party can raise a flag collectively).<br/><br/>Potentially, you can build conviction gain into your existing stakes mechanic as well.  The Player simply says "I convince him to let me pass, and I gain a conviction, against he calls the guards" and the GM says "roll" or "no bet".  This requires the GM to have a keener eye for judging stakes, but I think it preserves the balance you want.  In fact, I think it rewards retiring players, because they can gamble for a simple mechanical advantage, rather than something showstopping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Ryan Stoughton's "Raising the Stakes" Hack for d20 - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4311/ryan-stoughtons-raising-the-stakes-hack-for-d20/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Ryan Stoughton's &quot;Raising the Stakes&quot; Hack for d20 - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4311/ryan-stoughtons-raising-the-stakes-hack-for-d20/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I've been thinking about this thread a fair bit this week.

This enables really personal flags, like "I give up my vows", as well as party stakes like "we run out of time" (the party can raise a flag collectively).</blockquote>\nCurrently, I think as Ryan uses the system of Raising the Stakes that can be built into a raised stake and there's not need to Death Flag it.<br/><br/>For example, I can easily see in a scene where (this is all based on actual campaign), my cleric is trying to convince the younger members of noble family he's attached to that they should give up their licentious/hedonistic ways and attend to growing to be ready for their duties etc., he could raise stakes that as balance for a great success (e.g., not only success but they look to me for guidance and as they grow to the generation in power my cleric's influence grows) I can stake great failure (e.g., not only do I fail, but I end up myself being drawn into the same lifestyle and it's heading towards problems for my vows).<br/><br/>I pretty much did put stakes like this on table for an adventure at one point, it all went a bit differently (ended up being played out in more long form format where the short-form fast-narration approach above didn't apply).<br/><br/>That was all without invoking Death Flags, though Conviction was used.  What's nice about this (in my view) is that you can get all "narrative character depth" wild with it if that's your thing (which it is mine a bit), but the guy beside you who's all into cool action scenes can use it for that instead.  You don't need two different systems/economies for us both to do our thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99986/#Comment_99986" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T20:20:39+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  8:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I come late to the party. First of all, thanks to this thread I was made aware of "Raising the Stakes" and I really like the idea. Good job, Ryan!<br/><br/>I'm going to tweak this and use it in my next short campaign. <br/><br/>Regarding conviction and how to replenish it, I have an idea on how I'm going to tackle the problem. Beliefs and keys and all that stuff is nice but in a way, you've got that in D&amp;D. Alignments. I've always been disappointed by this aspect of D&amp;D. It is, in some ways, a central aspect of the game and does appear in places (lots of spells, magic items act/react to alignments, as well as class selection) but there aren't many mechancs centrally attached to it. <br/><br/>So I'm going to make alignments central to conviction. In and out.<br/><br/>In: By taking actions in accord with your alignment, you'll get conviction points. It's only going to be a small step from "getting points for showing up" but that will already be more to my tastes.<br/><br/>Out: I'm going to rework the way you can spend conviction. There will be a few "generic" ways you can spend it, like there is currently, and I'm going to find at least one special way for each alignment to spend conviction. A sort of signature thing. For instance, lawful-ly characters could be really zen in the middle of a fight, and be able to use the "take 10" rule during combat.<br/><br/>I might also work alignment further into other parts. I'm thinking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99990/#Comment_99990" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T01:52:17+00:00" title="September 30, 2007  1:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that alignment idea, Martin.

I haven't played DnD in a LONG time, but these hacks actually got me excited about playing. I may or may not use the E6 rules, I have to look at them some more and talk with my fellow players.<br/><br/>But I'm going to tweak the death flag. I'm going to to make the flag automatically lower after the conflict/combat. I'm also going to do as Mike H suggested and purposely make the conflicts/combats harder. I like the idea of the players &amp; enemies being dead even, where the players really only have a 50% chance of winning. Speaking of which, does anyone have suggestions for how much I should raise the CR levels to achieve my desired level of difficulty (this will be, if I'm remembering right, the first time I've GM'ed 3.<i>x</i>)?<br/><br/>Ryan &amp; Rob, I also have a quick question about your experiences---how often have the players in your group(s) "raised the stakes" in conflicts/combats? My hippie tendencies will probably encourage liberal amounts of raising/setting stakes. I was just curious what your experiences were.<br/><br/>The game, as planned, is only going to be a 1- or 2-shot.

To make it even, have four CR 3 creatures.  There's actually a chart in the DMG that gives you a lot of information about this.  Using creatures more than a couple points above the reccomended CR is a big deal, though, because they start to get "save or die" attacks, deal massive amounts of damage, or have special immunities that a lower level party will have no chance against.  Increasing the number, rather than the level, is probably a safer bet until you get a feel for what the party can handle.  That said, with death off the table, you've got more ability to play around and find what works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100125/#Comment_100125" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T07:07:56+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  7:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I somhow missed your response, Ryan.

Perhaps I'm a bit dense, and you could explain it to me in somewhat greater detail. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of "playing the Right way"... if that's not what you're doing, then why do you have rules at all? Rather, you've presented what I'm suggesting with loaded terms when I'm seeking to do with my rules suggestions precisely what you seek to do, and what all RPG rules seek to do: create player behaviors that are entertaining to themselves and all participants. If your objection is, in fact, that you don't want to narrow behaviors too much in a specific way, that's an objection we can discuss. But if you're going to claim that your rules exist to do something more egalitarian than the rules I'm proposing, then I'm afraid you've lost me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Simon may be onto something, too. That is, you might be able to combine the two mechanics, Raising the Stakes, and Death Flag by making raising the death flag just another sort of stake. It's really the same thing: "I automatically gain 6 Conviction, which'll give me a better chance to win, vs my character dies if I lose. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100159/#Comment_100159" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T08:38:42+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:38AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>I think you may have Forge blindness, because your argument doesn't see some basic tenets of bog-standard role-playing outside the realm of reward-system-driven behavior-oriented RPGs, which, like you, I play a lot of. In "Raising the Stakes," that's not the case, on purpose: the reward system you see (gaining Conviction) isn't supposed to drive behavior. The resource system drives behavior, or more accurately, the resource system reflects and enhances behavior.<br/><br/>In most role-playing games, this is how behavior and reward play out. Players have a limited number of resources, and they use them when they find them appropriate, or when they are most invested. For a simple example, imagine giving players in a D&amp;D game one Potion of Bull Strength for their characters. One player might choose to use it when fighting a creature known to have damage resistance, and another player might choose to use it when fighting the guy who killed his brother. Both of these players choose to be more effective when it matters to them, reflecting their goals (one - to know the system and be an effective player, two - to extract revenge in story, to have an emotional experience.) This is how games like D&amp;D, Vampire, Call of Cthulhu, and others manage to meet many Creative Agendas at once, by making the reward system secondary to the resource system, which is player-driven.<br/><br/>Conviction, of course, is a resource, that you spend on moments that your character's effectiveness matters to you. It is more egalitarian than only giving it for certain behaviors, in that it allows people with different reasons for playing to have a common language for their resources, and have individual methods of spending those resources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Generalized stakes for extended contests.  That's neat.  Of course, the original "Last Man Standing" pattern is generalized (the last person standing wins, everyone else dies).  But, replacing one generalized stake for another one is just plain cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think it would be good to set a stake to which all encounters default unless other stakes are set.  The default stakes could be something like: "You lose half of your remaining resources".  Then you could have other pre-set stakes that would reward players with varying amounts of Conviction.  For example:<br/>\n<br/>\n+1 Conviction: You lose all of your remaining resources<br/>\n+2 Conviction: You lose all of your remaining resources and are captured<br/>\n+3 Conviction: You are maimed<br/>\n+4 Conviction: You are severely maimed and lose all of your remaining resources<br/>\n+5 Conviction: You are severely maimed, lose all or your remaining resources, and are captured<br/>\n+6 Conviction: You are killed, but may be resurrected<br/>\n+7 Conviction: You are killed and may never be resurrected<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the option should always be available to negotiate stakes that are tailored to the situation.  But, having a set of generalized stakes would give players more options and still avoid most of the overhead of actually going through the negotiating process in every scene.  A player could just say, "I'll take the standard +3 stakes".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114679/#Comment_114679" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-16T19:57:04+00:00" title="December 16, 2007  7:57PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone cares, I think I figured out a way to do what Mike wants while doing what I want too.

I don't really see it as "story gamey". Instead, I think it's a damn fine stunts system that <i>works</i>.<br/><br/>I love stunts. Clinton (the DM) likes stunts. He researched a bunch of optional/homebrew stunt systems to incorporate. Most of them were extremely detailed and crunchy, basically attempting to spell out all sorts of special attacks or moves, with their own range of penalties and successes. Raising the Stakes is a lot more organic and flexible, but it's basically the same.  <br/><br/>We used it twice yesterday. There was an evil necromancer running at us with a glowing skull, obviously some sort of bad mojo. So I took a shot at it with a bow, saying "if I succeed I hit him in that hand, but if I fail..." shit, I forgot what the fail condition was, something like "he gets enraged and gets +4 to attack for 5 rounds"? Shane had one where it was a "if I succeed, I do an extra die of damage, if I fail my bowstring snaps and I can't use it for the rest of this (brutal and almost entirely long-range) combat". <br/><br/>Sometimes it takes a few minutes to find a suitable compromise, but it's a great, fluid risk/reward system without being too crunchy with all sorts of crazy modifiers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Also, there may be some benefit to having the Death Flag apply at 0 instead of -10 hit points.

We lucked out or strategized-out in order to scrape by. We had a familiar (with no flag) get down to -9 from 6 or 8 in one round, requiring a player to blow 3 conviction (the last of his conviction) to make the stabilization check or it would have died. That could have easily been one of us. It might be a little too hardcore for us. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114769/#Comment_114769" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T09:36:34+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  9:36AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Basically, make the reward system drive behaviour but in an egalitarian way.<br/><br/>Let's say each character has 4 Drives (Passion / Issue / Keys / whatever).<br/><br/>At the end of the scene, for each drive that was the subject of conflict in the scene, award<b>everyone in the group</b>a point of Conviction.<br/><br/>I think that would drive behavior, and encourage players to help each other hit the topics of their Drives.

I think using those to fuel conviction is a smoother approach than replacing d20's base experience system (so much PC authority derives from level, anything that makes level likely to move apart is problematic in my view as that gamist authority is likely important to anyone playing d20).  Another merit is that like Ryan's work <b>(Ryan, correct me if I'm off)</b>, TSOY is open to other's use under a creative commons licence.<br/><br/>I admit, pondering that based on having been thinking about using TSOY's keys to generate conviction or something like it intead of XP, though mulling the "economy" (in TSOY terms, how many XP for an advance becoming how many XP for conviction point, instead of 5 for advance, maybe 2 for conviction point).<br/><br/>This is part generally of thinking about TSOY-ifying d20 so that you play more "story faster" and invoking the tactical resolution mechanics as d20's own "bringing down the pain" (now be nice you who don't like d20 and avoid the obvious bon mots).  I've got to message Ryan sometime and ask him if TSOY influenced him because that's "not quite but almost" how he seems to GM.<br/><br/>To John Kirk,<br/><br/>John, by "resources" did you mean "wealth" or "daily resource use" (e.g., remaining spells, rage uses) etc.?  The former seems expensive and the latter doesn't work for all classes (e.g., Fighter).  However, I really like the idea of the scale, it's also a handy scale of reference for "what to stake" when you are not using Raising the Stakes in an "add on to tactical d20 resolution" but are simply doing "stakes based play, using d20 stats etc. to roll off".  This latter is what I've experimented most with my own group after playing with Ryan and seeing him use it.<br/><br/>On the latter, "scale of what to stake", though any particular scale depends on a game system and what aspects of character it emphasizes (e.g., staking a relationship means more in Dogs in the Vineyard than in d20), the idea of a "meta scale" also strikes me as interesting.  Has anyone seen something like that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114771/#Comment_114771" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T09:47:45+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  9:47AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've noticed from AP feedback and my own game: Players are much better at cmoing up with the "good" side of the stakes.

If it's that, then a learning approach to move players to proposing both sides of the frame is a good idea rather and utlimately less work than "carrying them".  There is so much goodness to be had by a player on either side of success with narrational rights once people start to see it, and relief of burdens on a GM.  Negative stakes setting is "pre-narration of failure" and the right to "narrate failure" is such a good thing to have.<br/><br/>(and lunch is up, back to work)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114823/#Comment_114823" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T14:13:56+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  2:13PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>Yeah, I agree that the player is much better at coming up with the good side.

Andy's recollection of yesterday's game points to that: he wanted to knock the skull out of this dude's hand, and did offer that the dude would be enraged and get a bonus to attack. That was lame, though - the skull had a giant bad guy bound to it. Since hitting it knocked the bad guy out of combat for two rounds, I countered with "the skull, instead of flying away, flies toward you" - decreasing the range and putting the bad guy instantly in hand-to-hand, which was nasty, as they'd built a nice bit of cover.

However, I also like the option of a cop-out. I remember once going "OK, I want to do X and Y.  DM, what's a good counter-stake/counter offer for that?"  Sometimes I can come up with some cool, fitting counter stakes. Other times it's hard for me (especially in a really tricky situ) to come up with a penalty for myself that I can swallow. So the DM (here, Clinton) coming up with counter-stakes, even if a little harsh, is sometimes easier to swallow as a player.<br/><br/>I dunno if it needs to be codified as "GM must set counter-stakes", but basically explaining that that option is readily available might get people into a pattern of asking the DM for some cool counters anyway.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114838/#Comment_114838" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T15:23:33+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  3:23PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, maybe a better approach would be just mentioning "GMs can help players with their stakes if they want" - I mean, I'm sure that generally happens anyway.
