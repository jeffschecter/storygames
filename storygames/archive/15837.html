What are the differences?

Other people's opinions are a greater influence on the final outcome of the design, with an eye towards target market and political reasons. Ability to call on large amount of resources (expensive software, skills from co-workers, etc.) that you might not otherwise have. A sense of "not pulling your weight" if the project is a failure. Ability to exploit licenses that you would not be able to touch without the backing of "the company." Or likewise, ability to be trapped by a license that would not be able to touch, but assigned to you to be done anyway because someone higher up thought it was a good idea. Getting paid is good.<br/><br/>Designing for personal fun - More experimental stuff. Can aim towards a very narrow market slice (namely me! if no one else) or simply not care. Ability to be the sole decision maker on changes. Can weight suggestions more purely based on personal biases of respondents (as opposed to weighting suggestions for political reasons). Control over timelines/deadlines. Disasters don't count against you, but still build your repertoire of tricks. Playtesting resources are harder to find, which includes time and players. Uses up "personal away-from-work time" which might be better spent doing something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359998/#Comment_359998" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T11:21:11+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 11:21AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2012 11:24AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Without the time to give this a lot of writing, but still wanting to get this said, I'll just offer a quick note here. (Also, I don't know what terms to apply to for-hire RPGs that aren't going to be incendiary to someone, given the kindling that's all around, so I'm sticking with that phrase\u2014"for hire"\u2014if only because it's already in use in this thread.)<br/><br/>Production on a for-hire game often ends in time for a print date so that a release schedule can be maintained so that cashflow can be maintained so that paychecks can flow. This is a disadvantage, in my experience, for the design of such games when compared to the "it's ready when it's ready" method of, for example, some Blizzard projects and some (most?) indie RPGs.<br/><br/>Some designers, studios, publishers can get away with release-date patching and follow-up expansions and alterations. Some cannot. It depends on the type of game (free MMO patches and updates are routine), the social capital of the publisher, and myriad other factors. <br/><br/>Many related differences between the two approaches stem from this core difference, in my experience. Lots of other perceptions (such as what "safer" design might mean) get tangled up or tinted based on whether a game was produced as a full-time or part-time venture, for better or worse. These end up being notable factors when determining benefits to each approach. Money changes everything and it doesn't take much.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Are we talking about RPGs, specifically, or games in general? The differences are considerable and varied. I've tried to split the difference here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360348/#Comment_360348" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T20:12:20+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  8:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done both quite a bit. <br/><br/>For me...<br/><br/>Designing games for hire: you spend lots of time on it because someone is paying you for it. There's a real incentive to actually produce something for the same reason. But honestly it becomes a job like anything thing else. Criticism doesn't<br/>always hurt so bad since it's not "your" game. <br/><br/>Designing games for fun: you spend lots of time on it because it's your passion, and hopefully something you'd want to show off to your friends and play with them. But there's no one standing over your shoulder to finish it. You have to really be a self-starter. Criticism can be tough to take when it's your baby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
