That way everyone can have a say about what kind of thing they'd like to have possibly come up during the game. But, of course, Technoir being Technoir they won't know HOW the element will come into play.<br/><br/>Having built a couple transmission on my own I can't see this being too long or terrible of a process and I have a sheet made up to use to keep track of everything and build the Connected/Unconnected lists.<br/><br/>The group will be Myself and 5 players(A bit large I know) so I figure basically we would each contribute one of each Plot Node category.<br/><br/>I was just wondering if anyone else has tried this and if so how it went. And if you haven't, but have an idea for how to make it work also let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403489/#Comment_403489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T16:18:36+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  4:18PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't done it actually sitting at a table as I was playing online. Transmission creation as a part of group play preparation worked fine in those circumstances and I don't think it would cause any problems at the table either.<br/><br/>When I did this I already had a distinct setting idea in mind, so I filled in about half the Transmission chart elements myself before colluding with the players. After pitching the setting and a bit of discussion about the details the players took turns creating the remaining Transmission elements. I had a chart prepared to enter all the elements on and created wiki pages for the details about each element as it was created. Obsidian Portal pages, actually, but close enough.<br/><br/>As long as you're organized, and you and your group are on the same general page as to whether you're playing 'standard' Technoir or if they can go farther afield in creating the Transmission elements, then things should probably go pretty smoothly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01" title="Tensen01"><img alt="Tensen01" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/257/nJB7ZNBC44W33.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01">Tensen01</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403497/#Comment_403497" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T17:05:18+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  5:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I have a few elements I want in the game already planned, but I am going to wait until then to add them to the list so everyone can hear them at the time. As for setting and such I have no plans what so ever. I am going to try to rein things in if I have to. I want it to be fairly "standard" Cyberpunk fair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01" title="Tensen01"><img alt="Tensen01" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/257/nJB7ZNBC44W33.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01">Tensen01</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405358/#Comment_405358" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T06:54:22+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  6:54AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thought people might like to know that we made the Transmission this past Saturday and everything went well.<br/><br/>The game we have is set in future Sydney, Australia.<br/><br/>Some of the interesting things are...<br/><br/>(Faction) KMN Inc. A large corporate conglomerate of several Aboriginal tribes who have joined in an effort to take back what was once theirs through money and power.<br/><br/>(Event) a High-Profile Assassination at the Sydney Operahouse<br/><br/>(Connection)Numbers, a Rogue AI Bookie and Fence. (No one knows he's an AI)<br/><br/>(Location) The Ziggurat, A Corporate Arcology and headquarters on KMN Inc<br/><br/>(Object) a Canister or Dormant, Unprogrammed Nano-tech<br/><br/>(Threat) The Kize Kize, a Cannibalistic street gang<br/><br/>The Setting is rather interesting. Australia is still a major nanny-state and is collapsing because of it. Guns are highly illegal. There are huge slums. The Local Government(Run by several Mining Concerns) is currently engaged in a hot &amp; cold war with KMN. The Bush has become a Mad Max-like dangerous wasteland hounded by scavenger gangs and torn by Bush Wars between the KMN and the Miners. There's a large Japanese population(Japan and Australia became allies during the conflicts that turned Japan into the radioactive wasteland it currently is).<br/><br/>I will post the full Transmission once I get it typed up and formatted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
