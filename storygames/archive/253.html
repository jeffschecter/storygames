                    Sometimes one has the urge to game!  But there's no group around--so, no problem!  Sit down with some books and work up a character, or a world, or (for some people on these boards) an RPG.  But, like, if there's no group around to play with, that effort generally goes to waste. <br/>
<br/>
How often do people do this?<br/>
<br/>
If you do it, why?<br/>
<br/>
What are the consequences of doing it?  Is it a good or bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
Are some designs more prone to this than others?  Is it a desireable design feature or not?<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>
I do it too much.  I generally recognize it when it's happening, and kind of resent it, but I'm really bored.<br/>
<br/>
I do it mainly as a kind of doodling: at work or in class, I can't play music, paint a picture, or read novels.  So, since I either know all the rules or have them as PDF's, I go from there.  (On the other hand, that doesn't explain why it's gaming, as opposed to, say, writing a novel, or learning a programming language.)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect it's a bad habit.  You end up investing a fair amount of time in the hobby just for the hell of it, and there's never any return on that investment, which sucks.  But also, I suspect that when I play, I'm always wondering: "Y'know, this is kinda fun, but does it redeem the time spent on other stuff?"  Which isn't fair to the other players, the GM, or me.  YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
(As an aside, I think this phenomenon might be one of those factors influencing the use of Force.  "I've spent a year developing this setting, I'll be damned if I'll let you guys trash it in the name of having fun!")<br/>
<br/>
D&amp;D totally facilitates this habit, perhaps to the extent that it's the majority of time spent with the books--making characters "just in case," etc.  This feature is probably a strong part of the game's economic performance: you can use 'em "solitaire" and there's always a use for one more book.  Primetime Adventures, in contrast, makes this kind of stuff impossible.  There's probably several points in between, depending.                </div>

                            Lonely Fun, which is my favorite new gaming term.  I'm with Tony - I've sublimated almost all my Lonely Fun urges into the Lonely Fun of creating new games.                        </div>

                            I have to say that I spent too much time in my youth creating systems / building vehicles / drawing starship deckplans in Traveller. And yep, barely 10% of that stuff actually ever saw use within a game (although I did like deckplans as it made things more 'real' to me).<br/>
<br/>
But as for creating new games during "Lonely Fun" times - that really does sound like a euphemism for something - I get discouraged. I have little enough time to play the games I have already got, let alone finding playtest time for my idle designs. And if a game system will never see play, well, I get discouraged. More so than if I had just created a new 'solo pitch' for PTA or whatever.                        </div>

<p>Well, I (and, I suspect, Jason) am approaching it from the assumption that any game I put effort into making will be playtested, finished, printed and sold.</p>

                            Yeah, but if you can't manage to get your group to involve your (say) new Cyberpunk corp writeup (or whatever you used to do as Lonely Fun), what are the odds that you will be able to get them to playtest your new game design you came up with?<br/>
<br/>
I do want to get involved in game design and publishing, but I do get this feeling that I will stumble at the playtest phase, as I won't be able to arrange my group to carry out any useful playtesting.                        </div>

                            Warren, join Game Chef next month.  No really.  Do it.  For the experience.<br/><br/>On topic:<br/><br/>What I find interesting about the question is that there's nothing that says that RPGs can't also be played on your own.  GURPS used to have solo adventures, like choose-your-own-adventures, that used GURPS mechanics.  Additionally, I spent tons of time designing vehicles and making characters and dude, that was <em>fun</em>.  Hell yes, this helps explain some success stories, because the product had more than on entertaining use, and that's awesome.<br/><br/>The thing about Lonely Fun is that it is, still, Fun.  I don't think it's worthwhile comparing it to Communal Fun, because they're different animals.  I do think, however, that it's worthwhile to consider how we can design game products that provide both Lonely Fun <em>and</em> Communal Fun.                        </div>

Which is why I don't like the "Lonely" part of the term -- lonely has negative connotations. Solo Fun would be a little less negative.                        </div>

Towns are very functional-dependent items that are really only good for use in a game, and require that game in order to be useful.                        </div>
