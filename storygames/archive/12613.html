It didn't come together, but Harry reminded me about it this year when the nominees were announced. He got in contact with a bunch of people, offered his house up, and organized the whole thing. We're not going to be able to do it until after the awards, but it should be super fun and I for one think it will be kind of fun to play Kagematsu, Montsegur 1244, and Chaos in the Old World all in a day and look back and try to judge which I think is best.<br/><br/>Hey, let's make this more of a topic: Have you held small game days like this, where there was a theme or focus, or gone to one? How about an Awards game day?<br/><br/>I think it was also Harry who had the idea to get together, watch one or a couple Coen Bros. movies and then play Fiasco. After this DJA day I really want to make that happen.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283401/#Comment_283401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T18:25:21+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  6:25PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2010 6:25PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://sc4.stylefeeder.com/thumb/21/b7/21b7khtt/21b7khtt-200.jpg"/><br/>The closest we've come is theming our house cons around the resident cats. I love the idea of a local award celebration day or a very specific house con topic, like "only old skool" or "only sci fi". Keep us posted on this, Hans! I'm sure it will go great with such a kick-ass lineup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283407/#Comment_283407" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T19:33:49+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  7:33PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>or a very specific house con topic, like "only old skool" or "only sci fi"</blockquote>\nInterestingly enough, the Raleigh Meetup Group does exactly this, although they usually meet at a game store for a day. The "Sci Fi/Space Opera" day is coming up in a week or so, I think.<br/><br/>In Japan, they've got something called " (Game) Only Cons", where basically one game only is played throughout the con, usually not like The Most Famous game, but other games. Sometimes its done as a promotional event for new releases.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
