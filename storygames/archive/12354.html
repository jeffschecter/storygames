There is a really long draft waiting to be edited by the inestimable Ryan Macklin when he gets a free chunk of time. I mean <i>long</i>. Like, 80,000 words. It's intentionally too long, so Ryan would be able to cut out all but the best 10% of valuable material. I mean, you can read it if you're crazy, but I didn't think anyone would be insane enough to actually <i>play</i> the game from this draft.<br/><br/>Obviously, I underestimated the enthusiasm and pure grit of the Italian gaming scene! Fabio and his friends created the following characters:\n<blockquote>Fabio Succi Cimentini (me): Pilgrim Ikuna the Resplendent Puppy<br/>Ariele Agostini: Pilgrim Lani the Mercurial Falls<br/>Bruno Capriati: Pilgrim Kaki the Sincere Koala<br/>Francesca Giacomini: Pilgrim Matareka the Dignified Arrow<br/>Mario Bolzoni: Pilgrim Taranga the Judicious Mosaic</blockquote>\nThe group decided to answer the following letter (written by Ben Lehman!):\n<blockquote>Dear Monk(s)<br/>Hi how are you! My name is Melanie. I come from a very small planet.<br/>There is me, my house, my cat, and two trees (see drawing).<br/>I am not so good, because my planet has been eaten by a whale.<br/>It is a very small planet. I woke up and I was inside a whale. I don't want to get (more) eaten.<br/>Please help!<br/><br/>your freind<br/>Melanie (age 8)<br/><br/>P.S. Drawing is on the other side.<br/>P.P.S. I will make you cookies.</blockquote>\nFabio translated the following AP from Italian, so forgive any quirks of grammar, but really it makes about as much sense as any average session. :P<br/><br/>Note: The abbreviation ST stands for "Storyteller," a role that passes from one player to the next on each turn. The abbreviation TM stands for "Troublemakers," who are any players who are not presently the Storyteller. The number of stones the Storyteller keeps on her turn determines whether her pilgrim gets <i>In Trouble</i>. Other pilgrims can, if they draw and keep the right stones, get that pilgrim (or themselves) <i>Out Of Trouble</i>. I can explain the rules in more detail, but this is a long post as it is.\n<blockquote>ROUND 1<br/><br/>FABIO: 2 Black Stones<br/>ST: Ikuna is the first Pilgrim to enter the belly of the whale, lighting the way with her glistening gold body.<br/>TM: But before she reaches Melanie's planet, she is bewitched by the luminous baleens of the whale<br/><br/>ARIELE: 3 White Stones<br/>ST: Lani takes a stroll upon the whale's gastric acid, then swims into the soft palate to force the beast to cough<br/><br/>BRUNO: 2 Black Stones<br/>ST: Kaki lands on the cavo orale of the whale, bandages Ikuna whole with his meditation bends and carries her away, saying \u201cYou want the beast to keep eating the planet?\u201d<br/>(Ikuna out of Trouble)<br/>TM: The coughing of the whale launches Kaki away, who ends up being tangled up between baleens.<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 1 White Stone<br/>TM: Matareka reaches the planet, Melanie hugs her pleading her to save the cat. \u201cHe just flew away!\u201d<br/>ST: But she literally reaches the cat on the fly and brings him back to the girl.<br/><br/>MARIO: 2 Black Stones<br/>ST: Taranga throws himself in the blowhole, just as he glances Melanie's house <br/>TM: But he's blown away by the pressure<br/><br/>ROUND 2<br/><br/>ARIELE: 1 Black Stone<br/>TM: The whale keeps on coughing, and Lani is violently knocked from one side to another<br/>ST: He swims upwards and reaches the whale's palate<br/><br/>BRUNO: 2 Black Stones<br/>ST: As whalebone is not so different from tree branches, Kaki can wrestle his way out and lands on the planet.<br/>TM: But he's instantly recognized by the trees on the planet... and he's quite notorious among vegetables, so they're not really happy.<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 2 White Stones<br/>ST: Matareka begins to navigate the planet across the puke streams towards outside.<br/>TM: But as the planet's weight unbalances, she falls in the stream and is carried onwards.<br/><br/>MARIO: 2 White Stones<br/>ST: Luckily Taranga bound himself with elastic cords to the whale's mouth as Matareka taught him, so he's brought back to the start<br/>TM: But the backthrust is too strong... and he lands on the house's roof. Smashing it.<br/><br/>FABIO: 2 White Stones<br/>ST: Marching on with eyes still blindfolded, Ikuna ends up hanging from the mouth of the whale, who starts to follow the Pilgrim-emitted light turning downwards and pushing the island in its throat close to the outside.<br/>TM: But she's struck by the downflowing streams and covered whole with a disgusting green patina which freezes her in horror.<br/><br/>ROUND 3<br/><br/>BRUNO: 1 White Stone<br/>TM: The trees are Whomping Willows!<br/>ST: But Kaki knows their weak spot: so he throws them Mel's star-shaped cookies, which they love, with a \u201csoporific cookie throw\u201d<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 2 Black Stones\u2028<br/>ST: Matareka grabs the cat's tail and manages to reach the bank.<br/>TM: But the angry cat assaults her,<br/>\u2028<br/>MARIO: 1 White Stone<br/>\u2028TM: As he wakes up, Taranga sees an enraged Melanie attack him with a rolling pin<br/>ST: The beating causes Taranga to blow up over and over, until he begins to lift the planet up<br/>\u2028<br/>FABIO: 1 Black Stone<br/>TM: As seaweed attaches itself to Ikuna, she draws the giant hungry plankton emerging.<br/>ST: Crying and all pissed, she blindly beats up everything in the path so she can give vent to her frustration and then calm down.<br/>\u2028<br/>ARIELE: 3 Black Stones<br/>ST: Lani can see everything. He then swim even upwards to force the3 whale to the ultimate sneeze.<br/>(Here we had finished all the Goal Words: but no-one reached 8 words yet. So we went on.)<br/><br/>ROUND 4<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 1 Black Stone<br/>TM: The cat enlarges everytime it angrily blows at Matareka<br/>ST: But as it reaches the size of cow, she eventually knows how to deal with it and calms it down.<br/><br/>MARIO: 3 White Stones<br/>ST: Using the elastic cords Taranga manages to ferry the planet out of the puke stream.<br/><br/>FABIO: 1 White Stone<br/>TM: But Ikuna is still near to the plankton, and the whale is still hungry.<br/>ST: She is falling asleep, though, and seeing her all curled up ready to slumber softens the whale... which ends up placidly following the planet.<br/><br/>ARIELE: 1 Black Stone<br/>TM: But the cords are too dry and Lani is slipping down<br/>ST: He rubs them on whale mucus, so he's manage to climb.<br/><br/>BRUNO: 2 White Stones<br/>ST: After striking the trees Kaki takes care of them until they blossom.<br/>TM: But the planet may be too small for a third tree..!<br/><br/>8 Stones are reached. All GW weres marked.<br/><br/>END GAME \u2013 PARADES<br/><br/>MARIO: Taranga binds the whale in the elastic cords.<br/>ARIELE: Carrying bucketfuls of building material, Lani repairs the roof.<br/>BRUNO: Kaki puts the newborn tree in a vase, then he greets Melanie goodbye and begins to depart.<br/>FABIO: Ikuna cuts off her hair so she can weave a shiny golden flag to direct the whale so it can drag the planet everywhere Melanie wishes to go<br/>FRANCESCA: And Matareka teaches Mel how to cook plankton sushi. Every hunger issue is solved!</blockquote>\nAnd then they played <i>another</i> letter after this! Fabio hasn't translated that story yet, but I'll post it as soon as he does.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
