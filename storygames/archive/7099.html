Think Lord Byron meets Van Helsing. Or John Wilmot, Earl of Rutherford meets Cugel the Clever...or Marquis de Sade...get the idea?<br/><br/>I want the addictions, afflictions, madness, and ennui of the characters, as well as their wealth and reputations to play a large part in the emerging fiction. I want the mechanics to reflect this. I've considered writing a homebrew system, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel. Intuition is telling me that FATE or TSoY could handle it, and a friend suggested looking into Heroquest.<br/><br/>Any opinions? Any advice on how to hack existing systems to do what I want?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157926/#Comment_157926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-22T12:43:06+00:00" title="July 22, 2008 12:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2008 12:44PM by Peter_Aronson.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <em>think</em> <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16616&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Houses of the Blooded</a> can handle this with a little playing around, or even as is if you don't mind the built-in setting.  Mind you, my experience with the game is limited to playing in a demo of the game at a con, which used a subset of the rules, and a read-through of the preview PDF.

It's not as good at dealing with challenges outside human scale, so a lot of its utility would depend on the tone you chose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157958/#Comment_157958" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-22T16:10:36+00:00" title="July 22, 2008  4:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I checked out this thread thinking you were going to play a game about Pete Doherty. <br/><br/>Your actual idea is probably better.
