However, as someone who games regularly but has never really enjoyed many indie games, I think that the non-focused, conflicting games that most gamers engage in deserve some thought other than "they're broken and need to be fixed".<br/><br/>So I thought I'd share some of my observations on my regular game and see what you people think.  Apologies if they're not completely clear as I've only really started formulating them recently.<br/><br/>To start with, I consider myself a 'casual gamer'.  By this I mean that as a player, my main aim in most games is the social side of things.  I like cracking jokes, tossing ideas around and I like the structured environment that a regular game brings with it.  By making this clear, I'm hoping to make clear my perspective on games as well as what my 'creative agenda'.  I don't really get on with immersing myself in my character and the 'game' aspects of roleplaying such as combat and rules tweaking bore me.<br/><br/>This means that I tend to think about my game not in theoretical terms or even in terms of pre-theoretical gaming folk wisdom such as 'railroading vs. freedom' or 'role vs. role'.  I think about the dynamics of my game in terms of the social dynamics of the group.  When things go right I think in terms of people being in good moods and when things go badly I think of people being unhappy, of key personalities not being at the table and of clashes between personalities.<br/><br/>For me, this is the level at which sessions are made and broken.  Not at the level of failures in social contract, clashing creative agendas or any of the other diagnostic theoretical concepts that are floating around out there.  Despite having a background in philosophy and a largely theoretical PhD, I've never really embraced theory because it has always struck me as an attempt to reinvent the wheel; a dressing up of straight-forward intuitively understood human problems in language about games.  I think that whether you are bowling, swinging, sewing or playing D&amp;D, Vampire or DitV the same social forces hold and so the same types of explanation are required.  In short :<br/><br/><b><br/>System does not matter.  Rules do not matter.  Content does not matter.  People matter.</b><br/><br/>That's observation one.<br/><br/><br/>Observation two flows from the fact that most gaming is unfocused and features conflict between the players and GM as they try to impose upon the game their expectations for the genre or for what will be fun.<br/><br/>Forge theory describes this as malfunctioning gaming.  I would argue that it is standard at most tables and as such is normal gaming and I think it is unfortunate that most theory has come to focus not upon understanding this type of gaming but rather upon understanding the more narrowly focused type of gaming you see embodied in most indie games.<br/><br/>For me, any group has internal power struggles.  The balance of power within most social groups is forever shifting in accordance with people's moods, people's energy levels, people's recent history and the situation at hand.  When a group makes decisions it feeds all of these factors in along with a host of others and some people decide to stand their ground, others decide to argue and eventually a decision is made but once that decision is made, the situation changes and the balance of relationships is adjusted again.<br/><br/>As this is normal in most social groups, it is also normal in most gaming groups.<br/><br/>The GM arrives at the table with an idea in mind, one player just wants to kill things, another wants to crack jokes, another thinks they want the same thing as the GM but actually is drawing on different source material or has just misunderstood the email describing tonight's game.  When the group sit down to play, the balance of power representing the dominant creative agenda enters into a state of constant flux.  Out of this chaos, the game's flavour and themes and quality emerges.  Or, to put it another way...<br/><br/><b>Games emerge solely from group interaction.  A game has no existence in the head of the GM, the players, the designer or in the text of the rulebook.  Its character, form and quality is entirely the product of the group in play.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185367/#Comment_185367" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T16:20:49+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  4:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I can see where you are coming from here, but it seems like you are casting your point of view to be so strongly exclusive of others that it is simply not going to stand up. <br/><br/>Content, system and rules do not matter?

The chief realization that came about in this community thanks to a conversation between Emily and Vincent (a.k.a. the Lumpley Principle) was that "system" was really just the set of all interactions between the players at the table, which is functionally similar, I think, to your "People matter" assertion.  <br/><br/>Honestly, I think the pan-Forge indie community is still dealing with the theoretical fallout of switching our attention to social interactions instead of rules and the "shared imaginary space" (a.k.a. Ron's "exploration").  For example, Vincent's recent design work -- at least from what I can tell on Anyway -- seems based around trying to figure out how the social contract that surrounds playing a roleplaying game actually works.  Like, if I fail a roll, what are the things that can happen as a result without breaking the social contract?  Can the GM hose my character by putting me in a terrible situation?  Can he take away my cool stuff?  Under what circumstances can he kill my character and have it feel fair or even justified?  Those aren't about the rules or content, but are about social interactions between people.<br/><br/>I'm definitely very interested to hear what other things you have to say about theory and issues you've had in the past with the Forge stuff.  Honestly, though, it seems to me like theory is in the process of shifting much more in the direction you're indicating here.  However, it's important to realize that there are very few records of theoretical developments since Ron's original GNS articles, especially developments since the Theory forum was shut down.  Nobody is really writing articles describing the current state of indie game theory in this community, but it's certainly at a very different place than it was several years ago.  The only way you can really keep up with it is following a variety of forums, blogs, playtests, and newly published games.  Even then, it's really, really hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185379/#Comment_185379" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T17:49:11+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  5:49PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2008 5:50PM by Graham.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathon, this largely sounds in line with the theory developed at the Forge. Everything around the Big Model starts with the players and Actual Play: when you say that a game's "character, form and quality is entirely the product of the group in play", that's classic Forge stuff.<br/><br/>(I'm not saying that to dismiss what you're saying, but to point out an area of crossover).<br/><br/>For me, the most interesting thing is what you're saying about group dynamics. That's something that could use more analysis.<br/><br/>A question back at you: if you consider the game as facilitating the group interactions - a medium through which the group interacts - could you begin to accept that "system matters"?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185403/#Comment_185403" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T22:21:45+00:00" title="December 30, 2008 10:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure actual play is the same as people matter. (or even to say a little bit ) <br/><br/>I can kind of see the trend to make these great games that depend on the people in some sense being Dependant upon the group and not their play. The conflict between player and gm works because the players have acted on this conflict and embraced it before play began. God knows I've smushed my fair share of perfectly valid play and creative endeavors because of personal stuff. Lots of this stuff preexists and postexists (?) around your actual play, and only exists beside it during the play. I think this kind of expresses the how of some of the problems I have with many indie games (just myself here) because they rather deliberately try to conflate these two currents of stuff, game stuff and people stuff in an attempt to make a bigger and better game stuff, (among these experiences include games that try to make me learn something, experiance something, be authentic, or otherwise be emotional exploration) when in fact the people stuff just takes care of itself fine. <br/><br/>Not to knock the other's who have contributed , but if you ask a cancer doctor what's wrong with someone... it inevitably cancer. I hope the op continues his exclusionary and radical game (and People) thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185404/#Comment_185404" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T23:41:56+00:00" title="December 30, 2008 11:41PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2008 11:57PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>A question back at you: if you consider the game as facilitating the group interactions - a medium through which the group interacts - could you begin to accept that "system matters"?</blockquote>\nI'm not entirely sure I understand the distinction being made here.  I've always thought that the system matters...<i>to the people who are playing with that system.</i><br/><br/>On its own, in some kind of theoretical vacuum, I'm not even sure there's a system there, you know?  It's one side of the teeter-totter: if "people" isn't sitting on the other end of the plank to make it move, the system just plants its ass on the ground and goes nowhere.  You can talk about system, but until you're talking about how a particular group deals with that particular system (according to its particular current mood, in the particular place they're gathering to play, etc.), it doesn't really "matter" except in the most nebulous and speculative way. <br/><br/>Mind you, I also have a sneaking suspicion that while system certainly can matter (to some groups in some games yadda yadda yadda), really, it's people who matter MORE.  The people are going to have a bigger effect on everything than the poor dead leaves of any system ever could.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185408/#Comment_185408" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T02:21:21+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  2:21AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think about the forge community as a bunch of chefs trying to build restraunts.<br/><br/>Mr.Forge: "I like eating, but all the food in this town is kind of gross.

Deadlines to meet.  I shall respond to some of your comments :-)<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>  -- I am as flexible as a reed and if people want to 'talk me down' from those assertions I'm happy to discuss the matter.<br/><br/><br/><b>Jonathan</b> -- I'm a big fan of the Lumpley Principle and it has always struck me as the best idea to come out of the Forge.  However, I think that to a certain extent it does not go far enough as it is still invoking these nebulous concepts such as "social contract".  That's a concept ported across from political philosophy but it's not clear to me the role played by that idea in every day social interaction.  My view is that if games are all about social interaction then a separate body of theory (separate from social psychology and sociology) is muddying the waters at best and re-inventing the wheel at worse.<br/><br/>I don't think that conceptual analysis or abstract talk can resolve any of the questions you raise.  I think they vary from group to group and the answers lie within the wider tapestry of human social rules.  For example, just how much a GM can mess with you after fumbling an etiquette role seems to me precisely the same question as to how much your friends can mock you after you do something stupid like spill your drink down yourself or accidentally call the teacher 'mom'.  There's a point at which 'playful teasing' becomes 'being a dick' and I don't think that line is determined by what a group is doing.  Hence my view that system, rules and content of game do not matter.<br/><br/><br/><b>Graham</b> -- My practical view is that system doesn't in fact matter but as part of a self-fulfilling prophecy it does.  In other words, people arrive at the game with a set of preconceptions and they play those preconceptions.  It's like the idea that Cthulhu is all about the slow decline into death and madness or that Warhammer is all about grubbing a living as a member of a fantasy renaissance society.  In truth, both games can be played as heroic combat games but I think that people read what they want into the text of the game.  The author is dead and so on...<br/><br/>As a result, when I GM I treat system a bit like kosher food.  I don't think there's any real difference between kosher food and non-kosher food but I realise that as with religious custom, there's a set of symbols at play that means something to someone and I am happy to pay lip service to their irrational beliefs ;-)<br/><br/><b><br/>Logos</b> -- I think that there is some conflating of game stuff and people stuff or at least a belief that talking about game stuff is the same as talking about people stuff.  For example, the idea of focused thematic play is supposed to do away with conflicting creative agendas but this idea completely ignores that there's still going to be conflict in the group regarding whether or not a game is actually played.  I don't think there's a meaningful difference between "Steve wants to track up in the hills and hunt gnolls but I want to roleplay flirting with prostitutes" and "Steve wants to play Gnoll: the Hunting this week and I want to play Hooker: the flirting".  I think that focused systems merely kick creative agenda conflict upstairs.  Nothing is resolved.<br/><br/>Creative agenda conflict is more a question of personality clash than anything else.<br/><br/><b><br/>Accounting</b> -- Quite so.  It's the same as literary criticism; 'system matters' is a form of essentialism suggesting that buried within the words that make up the rulebook is some true form that can be understod or misunderstood.  I'm more of a modern critic who thinks that the only thing that actually exists is how people interpret the text of the rules.  I don't think it's possible to misunderstand a system as system has no meaning and no existence beyond the people using it.<br/><br/><br/><b>Sean</b> -- I'm not sure that's helpful as it's a rather slanted view of the debate.  A better way of thinking of it might be that there's a town in which people wander from restaurant to restaurant tapas-style having a dish here and a dish there until a couple of chefs say "what's with this wandering around garbage?  if you want to eat french then eat a French meal.  If you want to eat Chinese then have three courses of Chinese food".  My view is that the wandering around having a bit of this and a bit of that is not a failure to eat a style of food, it is a style of dining in and of itself.<br/><br/>But I tend to find that similies such as these rapidly spiral out of control and before long we'll be discussing the difference between tapas and dim-sum and then the point is lost :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trey%20Greer" title="Trey Greer"><img alt="Trey Greer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trey%20Greer">Trey Greer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186013/#Comment_186013" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T05:49:31+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  5:49AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree largely with what you have said, only I feel your statements are to absolute.

But to move forward and have productivity of any quality of game the group need to take certain axiom to proceed, a game simply run on intuition would take to long to develop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186016/#Comment_186016" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T06:14:09+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  6:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As is usually the case when this subject comes up, I am not seeing anything here that I don't understand as having been part of the "Forgey" consensus for some years now.<br/><br/>What you're describing is play in which no Creative Agenda is operating. Because what a group like that is doing is not "playing an RPG". They're socializing, with some intermediating formalisms derived from RPG texts and RPG culture. In order to be doing the activity of "playing an RPG", as I understand it, you have to actually settle on a consistently operating system and a reasonably consonant idea of "what we're trying to do."<br/><br/>That's in part a definitional thing, of course. "Playing an RPG" = "creating a fictional space through communication and collaboration, <b>and pursuing an emotional reward through the manipulation of the fiction</b>." A lot of play out there is not "playing an RPG"... it's playing <b>with</b> an RPG, more properly. The RPG is the ball you're kicking around, but the real game is in the kicking around, not where you're kicking it to.<br/><br/>There has to be some minimal level of <b>commitment to the content and purpose of the fiction</b> before most of the Forgey stuff comes into play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186017/#Comment_186017" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T06:20:19+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  6:20AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2009 6:22AM by Ludanto.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan M,<br/><br/>To avoid confusion (or maybe add to it, I don't know) the "system" in "system matters" IS the people at the table, or rather how they do things.  It's like you're saying "system doesn't matter, it's the system that matters".  In context, system doesn't mean rules or instructions (unless the table is using them, and even then it's not exlusive).<br/><br/>While you have some good points, I have to disagree with your assertion that "incoherent" play is a style and thus something to be sought as valuable.  That's essentially saying, "We play RPGs for the unwritten, unspoken, passive-agressive conflicts about metagame stuff and we like it."

I'll say something about:\n<blockquote>Games emerge solely from group interaction. A game has no existence in the head of the GM, the players, the designer or in the text of the rulebook. Its character, form and quality is entirely the product of the group in play.</blockquote>\nObviously, <b>an instance of play</b> emerges from group interaction - that is what it is. <br/><br/>A <b>game</b>, however, does have some separate existence from instances of play, as when the designer wrote it, when the players thought about it and planned for the instance of play, and as copies of the text lying around in the world. <br/><br/>I assume you mean that instances of play are always local and contingent on the group, but even then they are not unrelated to the game text, the designer's intentions, or the intentions of the players. These things all feed more or less directly into the creation of the instance of play created, and to claim that they are just a bunch of chaotic elements from which a game coalesces is disingenuous. Things happen in a rather more predictable fashion than that. <br/><br/>Still, I think your basic point is right - we do take all this inputs of game text, books and films read and watched recently, things we planned that are cool to do in the game and group interactions, past session events, and personal preferences, and feed them all together to bring out an instance of play. <br/><br/>I'm just wary of the casting it so radically. Games must have some existence in heads and texts, and instances of play must be constructed from those pieces (otherwise where do they come from?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186051/#Comment_186051" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T11:18:20+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 11:18AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My contention with your thoughts is the supposition that most gaming is unfocused.  It may not be a narrow focus but most games do have focus.  That is what the rules of the game do, they constrict what is possible to bring focus on what we want to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfocused gaming would be unplayable.  While one player is imagining a murder mystery in a fantasy world another is pretending what it would be like if they painted their house pink and who might stop by while they are painting and another is imagining who would win in a fight Superman or the Power Rangers.  You need, as a group, to focus on just one of those things or on some interesting combination of the three that will work for the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting acts as a focus so that everyone can imagine this world the game is taking place in and while everyone may not imagine things exactly the same they are close enough to each other that differences can be worked out.<br/>\nThe mechanical rules focus the game so that we can tell what type of actions are of interest in the game and how they will be governed.  Can you jump the tallest building in a single bound or is crossing the street a dangerous endeavor?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll give you that some games or some play may be too tightly focused but really that's a matter of taste.  If you find that you get a better sense of depth from a character after you've taken them for a stroll through a market more power to you but for some they crave the action of sticking to adventure and chasing down the villain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186052/#Comment_186052" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T11:19:55+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 11:19AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>as a player, my main aim in most games is the social side of things.

A books is made out of two things: the words inside it and the experience you have while reading it.<br/><br/>Saying that the system doesn't matter except as a self-fulfilling prophesy is like saying that Stephen King is only a horror writer because his books have creepy covers and everyone knows he's a horror writer. By that logic, Stephen King would be just as much a horror writer if he wrote books about happy bunnies, as long as the books had the same covers and people had the same expectations, which would be silly. In fact, Stephen King writes horror because A) he writes creepy words in his book which produce <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> creepy feelings in some of the people who read his books.<br/><br/>In my experience as a gamer, a gaming book is actually more like a really great cookbook. It is a set of instructions, anecdotes, examples, and abstract advice for taking certain ingredients and producing a certain effect. Of course, you don't need to follow the advice. You can take the advice in the book and do something else with it, but that matters.<br/><br/>Finally, it matters what you do at the table. Little GM tricks like, say, how rigorously to apply a psychological degeneration mechanic, how often to call for rolls, how powerful you allow starting characters to be, how deadly you make combat... these things work together to produce an experience that we call a game session. A gaming book includes a given set of standards for all those factors and more. If you can produce a given experience by how you apply those things, doesn't it follow that a game can do the same thing through the advice it offers prospective players and GMs?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186108/#Comment_186108" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T15:46:59+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  3:46PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think perhaps if you wanted to not bash and read charitibly it would go more like this. <br/><br/>A game is a book and the use of said book. <br/><br/>But the person reading it , obviously brings something to the table, to say otherwise seems really silly.

For some reason, gamers aren't willing to say "look, we'll play out some stuff with the whores this week and next week we'll chase down some gnolls, OK?" but they <i>are</i> willing to say "hey, let's try this game this week, and then maybe we can trade off with this other one."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186171/#Comment_186171" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T23:26:47+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 11:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2009 11:28PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting read. I find your assertions to be too extreme though.<br/><br/>"People matter" yes, but that does not exclude "system" from mattering. And it certainly does not exclude the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people</span> making the games ...<br/><br/>"Games emerge solely from group interaction" is too narrow, and when combined with dismissal of the gamebook/text/design and the fiction created ... well, then it is not shedding any light on the issue at all. One obvious question is; what is this "game" that is emerging from the interaction? You say nothing of it, and I suspect that is an oversight on your side, forgetting the produced <i>fiction </i>of the interaction.<br/><br/>It reminds me of an art-debate I participated in some months ago. The debate had disciples of three strange viewpoints:<br/>1 - The artist and his/her action is the <i>REAL </i>art.<br/>2 - The work of art itself is <i>THE </i>art.<br/>3 - The perception of the public is the <i>TRUE </i>art.<br/><br/>I consider each of the three stances to be dismissive of "the greater playing-field", each in their way. They fail to take into consideration that the "art" is present at all levels, and that the art-form is indeed a complex and fluxing entity consisting of <i>working artists</i>, <i>works of art</i> <b>AND </b><i>public perception of the artwork</i>.<br/><br/>If you manage to keep your head clear this is quite obvious. It should be in role-playing games too.<br/><br/>So I advocate that you keep a straight mind when talking theories.

The point is rather that there is never a fixed creative agenda as it emerges organically from play and the interaction of people at the table so there is a creative agenda or sorts but it is in a constant state of flux and may well be incoherent both within a participant and at the table.  My original post was motivated by the thought that rather than being broken play, this unfocused play is actually normal among most gamers AND an end worth pursuing in itself.<br/><br/><b><br/>Secondly A</b>, I think that texts and games are not the same thing.  I think that you can buy a text from a shop.  It is written by an author.  It has rules.  It has a shape.  However, all interpretations of a text are equally valid and that the games we play are made up of people's different interpretations poured through a meche of group dynamic and that the final result has only the vaguest of connections to the original text and what connections it does have exist because it is a social custom that people approach the text of RPG books in a certain way.<br/><br/><br/><b>Secondly B</b>, Stephen King may be marketed as horror but what I make of his books is up to me.  Once he has finished writing the book, its text is out of his hands.  If I decide to read it as a metaphorical exploration of life in New England then that's up to me and it's no more or less true than a King fan who thinks it's a horror novel.  Alternately someone like Joseph Conrad manages to write horror very well indeed without being aware that he is doing so.  Heart of Darkness' is horror because I can point to the conventions of the horror genre that it satisfies.<br/><br/><br/><b>Thirdly</b>, I don't think that I can be catered to by a set of rules because I am rules-averse.  I don't mean rules averse in the sense that I don't like crunch or I never bother to learn a system properly so as to make the most of it.  I mean that my mind slides off of the game element of most games.  I struggle to see the point of things like chess or sudoku because it feels utterly abstract and arbitrary... like some kind of intellectual chewing gum you use as a heat sink until something real comes along.  Even when I have been roped into a boardgame, I can't remember the last time I played to win.  I generally either go through the motions and chat alongside the game or I spend my time trying things out.  I used to play a lot of Diplomacy but I mostly played in order to cause chaos and see what would happen or as an exercise in psychology.<br/><br/>If someone presented me with scruples I'd ask why we wouldn't just have a conversation.<br/><br/>This colours my opinion of things and goes some way to explaining why I see RPGs as being al about the social stuff rather than all about what's in the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

They're what you want out of a particular game over the course of its existence. That might be a 1-shot, might be a years-long campaign. Whatever scale makes sense. People, complete with their personalities, want different things at different times.</p>\n<p>I think what might be going on here is that you're confusing scale. The time frame you're talking about \u2014\xa0"I want to hunt gnolls" vs. "I want to flirt with prostitutes" \u2014 is very short. Furthermore, what those players intend to do with that is unresolved. Is the gnoll-hunter addressing the dehumanization of others, while the john wants to add to his flirting skill? Or does the gnoll hunter want to explore the gnoll knoll while the john is showing how desperate he's become for companionship? There's no reason these two fictional actions can't take place in the same game. The question is whether each player is having a satisfying social experience creating a satisfying piece of fiction.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>this idea completely ignores that there's still going to be conflict in the group regarding whether or not a game is actually played.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>It doesn't ignore it.

You can read about it in Ben's <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/theforge/ben_theory_intro.html" rel="nofollow">intro</a> article.</p>\n<p>My feeling about Sim is that <em>you're making something beautiful</em>. Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, but fortunately, there are only a few beholders at the table at a time. Shreyas Sampat's <a href="http://summerbird.wordpress.com/the-mist-robed-gate/" rel="nofollow">Mist-Robed Gate</a> is a good example of that.

Specifically, the premise that the dysfunction is particularly widespread or marked compared to what you get with focused game design, and the premise that it's specifically attributable to design as opposed to social factors. You may find that your gaming is now much more satisfying than it once was, and there's no reason to doubt that. But your experience (for an abstract "you") isn't necessarily representative (this is obvious but it needs stating); moreover, you've not only switched to playing focused games but formed a community of <i>focused-gaming</i> fans.<br/><br/>Still if Jonathan is right (and as you might guess, I'm fairly sympa with his views) there's a bright side to this, which is that if the focused-gaming fans have now found each other, then maybe the unfocused-gaming fans can get on with their type of fun without being troubled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186184/#Comment_186184" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T04:26:25+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  4:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2009 4:26AM by Jonathan M.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, I'll deal with a couple of the questions you've raised.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I agree that those two agendas are not necessarily in conflict but I don't think that people approach the game with as clear a creative agenda as you suggest.  I think that their creative agendas are barely formulated and even if they are formulated, they're subject to being abandoned in favour of doing something else.  Play is defined by a constant churn of ideas and desires and that churn produces what the game is about.<br/>\n<blockquote> It doesn't ignore it. It explicitly considers it outside of the scope. </blockquote>\nI would sugest that that is a distinction without a difference :-)  I would also add that it raises serious question marks about the definition of "system".  My original post stated that system didn't matter as the character of a gaming session was defined by the clash of personalities and the general dynamics of the gaming group.  People responded that I was wrong to suggest that system doesn't matter as in fact what "system" means is the social contract and all of the social dynamics around the game too.  <br/><br/>However, now you're suggesting that focused games do not address a key element of game definition; the selection of the group's creative agenda.  I think that this is in conflict with the wider definition of system proposed further up the thread.<br/><br/>On a side note I have serious qualms about this redefinition of 'system' from 'rules' to 'everything that goes on at the table'.  It seems to me that it has become clear that actually rules aren't the only thing going on at the table but rather than chuck out a perfectly good slogan, people have chosen to redefine a term to the point where all the slogan really means is "what goes on at the table determines what goes on at the table".   Explanatory strength has been traded off against maintenance of validity.  But that's just my perception of what has gone on here.<br/>\n<blockquote>why would you flirt with prostitutes? Aren't they a sure thing? Aren't you just wasting their time?</blockquote>\nwhat kind of nutcase wants to go up into the hills in order to track down and murder tribes of sentient hyena-like primitives?  I can understand wanting to flirt with prostitutes because flirting is fun and it's not as though a hooker is going to be outraged by it but I struggle to understand people who go hiking, let alone people who go hiking in order to kill things :-)<br/>\n<blockquote>Now, if you're saying, "I don't care about having a powerful experience with the fiction. I care about hanging out with my friends," then it doesn't matter. As Ben points out in those essays, Creative Agenda is a theory developed with the assumption that you want to have the best game possible. If there are other, overriding concerns, CA won't really help you, except as a tertiary diagnostic tool.</blockquote>\nI'm not saying that.  I'm rejecting the assumptions that this paragraph is based upon.  I disagree that focused gaming necessarily produces a more powerful experience (but that's kind of beside the point), I also disagree that better games come from greater focus upon a particular creative agenda (I don't actualy think I'd be able to play a narrativist or a gamist game without getting bored).  What I'm saying is that non-focused gaming is a style of its own with its own rewards and that one of those rewards is the organic emergence of an evolving creative agenda determined not by explicit discussion but rather by the implicit clashes of different whims, desires, agendas, personalities and moods.<br/><br/>I'm happy that focused gaming exists but it is not the only kind of gaming there is.  Gaming existed as a hobby for decades before focused gaming came along and I think that rather than try to force non-focused gaming into the focused gaming box (a process which gives rise to false consciousness claims such as "you think you're having fun but you're not" and "you're not actually playing an RPG, you're hanging out with your friends" or "but you do fix a creative agenda, it's just that the information exchange is subtle").<br/><br/>As I said, feature not bug.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186188/#Comment_186188" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T05:16:01+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  5:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2009 7:26AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>If the focused-gaming fans have now found each other, then maybe the unfocused-gaming fans can get on with their type of fun without being troubled</blockquote>\nExcellent point, Elliot.<br/><br/>It's been years since my droogs and I broke into someone's home and beat the shit out of some folks playing unfocused D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186195/#Comment_186195" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T06:07:47+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:07AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2009 6:08AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>It's been years since my droogs and I broke into someone's home and beat the shit out of some folks playing unfocused D&amp;D.</blockquote> lol<br/><br/>Seriously: I do not see the point in making two opposed camps/forces/whatever out of something as diverse and dynamic as role-players and role-playing games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186199/#Comment_186199" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T06:33:10+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:33AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite><b><br/>System does not matter.

But there's literally no theoretical framework *unique to RPGs* that can address the use of RPGs as social lubricant or system-nominal play without any strong commitment to fictional content. Much like you wouldn't use sabermetrics in your beer league - whatever statistics may be there, they're completely meaningless for the purpose of the league, and analyzing them rigorously will net you at best misleading results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186209/#Comment_186209" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T07:18:41+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  7:18AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>I don't actualy think I'd be able to play a narrativist or a gamist game without getting bored.</blockquote>\nWell there you go.  That's a prime example of how the rules and instructions matter.  We have needs that aren't met by certain rules-sets.  Based on what you've said, you seem to need a low-commitment game that's interesting enough to distract or inspire when the conversation lags (the elusive "Beer &amp; Pretzels Creative Agenda" <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) .

I'll offer a quick counterpoint, with more to come if you want:<br/><br/> - "Not thinking about a CA" is not the same as "not having a CA."  <br/><br/>- The Big Model is about what we do, not about what it feels like to do it.  It is much easier to spot the techniques and practices within the CA of one's own play than to spot the CA itself, which tends not to show up in memorable instances, but rather as an organizing principle.<br/><br/>- Having a CA in your group has a lot to do with repeatability.  Rolling with the whims and moods of the moment either takes place within a shared CA or it doesn't; it doesn't "create a CA" unless it churns out something that ends the cycle of "start from scratch each session".<br/><br/>Combined with what Mark W. just said, I think that covers many of the bases here in terms of paving the way to talk about this stuff with a shared vocab.  If I've just reiterated a bunch of stuff you've already read elsewhere, I apologize.<br/><br/>I'll add that, in my own experience, I have had moments of RPG fun that were neither purely social nor within a coherent CA.  For example, figuring out how to disarm a complex magical trap.  The key word, here, though, is <i>moments</i>.  Once the trap was disarmed, it was back to some combo of fun socializing and not-reliably-mutually-fun play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186263/#Comment_186263" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T10:47:11+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 10:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree when you say the rules in the book and the game are not the same thing.  Further, I think that 'system' is somewhere between 'rules' and 'everything that goes on at the table', it is the actual rules that are used at the table.  Just because there are rules in the book doesn't make it part of the system.  You actually have to be using it while playing.  Furthermore, anything made up on the spot or consistently done (in terms of 'rules' or 'procedure') is part of system.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom your comments about your rules-averseness and board games I would say that I would very much not enjoy playing a board game with you (nothing person of course).  Simply because you would not be playing the same game as me, in a sense.  I'm trying to be the best at winning the game, but if you're playing with me and you're not trying to win, then you've silently negated my assumption that we're trying to win, which ruins my fun because I don't want to be defeated by someone who's not going to do well.

I've purchased two rulesets in the last six years and both of them were bought because of the non-rule stuff in the game books.  In the case of one of the games I actually dumped the rules after a few sessions as I couldn't be bothered to make sense of the combat rules and so I shifted to a different system that I was familiar with.<br/><br/>As for the "beer and pretzels" claim, I tend to consider it bad form to make those kinds of judgements about people I have never met, let alone never gamed with (Your mileage clearly differs though) but interestingly enough, my experience of indie games has lead me to think of them as abstract boardgames.  I actually refer to them as 'beer and pretzel RPGs' as, much like boardgames, they exchange breadth of experience for focus.<br/><br/>I play proper roleplaying games, if you look on the Who Am I thread you'll find links to some of the campaigns I run or take part in.  If you sat in on the game I think you'd find little difference between one of our games and the output of the average traditional group.  What differs is my perspective on the same phenomenon and my realisation that while I enjoy gaming, the actual game side of gaming is not what keeps bringing me back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186450/#Comment_186450" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T01:37:23+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  1:37AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite><br/>From your comments about your rules-averseness and board games I would say that I would very much not enjoy playing a board game with you (nothing person of course).

I can understand playing to win at poker or even strip poker but I have never really understood the point of wanting to beat someone else at something as inconsequential as a boardgame.  The idea of not wanting to be beaten by someone who isn't going to do well is just utterly outside my mindset, I wouldn't think in those terms.  I suppose it's a bit like playing a beat em up against someone who holds down the throw button but when that happens to me I see it as a challenge to work around and it can actually prove more interesting than standard beat em up play as that's more about working out how to do certain moves and then doing them again and again in relevant circumstances.<br/><br/>You're right that for me, the rules don't matter and that 'where I stand is defined by where I sit' so to speak and yes, there's an element of me wanting to make sense of my own attitudes towards RPGs.  But I also think that there's some more universal substance there.  Rules have no substance in and of themselves... they only have weight because people decide to give them weight by engaging with them.  This is the social contract.<br/><br/>I think that this is the level at which games are made and at which games are best thought about and explained... on the level of the group dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186464/#Comment_186464" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T04:07:57+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  4:07AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, in spite of my earlier support in favor of "unfocused gaming" I will say that I disagree with the "system doesn't matter" line, in general.<br/><br/>I admire the way you lay it out; you have something to say and you don't mince words. The original "System Does Matter" essay was <i>precisely</i> advocating the importance of game texts (as well as making a first stab at defining an aesthetic for focused gaming, particularly of the N-type). You don't think game texts matter. There's an argument to be had, and it won't go away by means of redefinition of terms. I just disagree, even if we restrict discussion to the range of "traditional" games and traditional game groups. For <i>you</i>, game design and game texts don't matter because you've chosen to ignore them (or you're predisposed to ignore them), but I think you're pretty extreme in this respect.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of an essay about Runequest I read somewhere (unfortunately I haven't been able to dig it up on the spur of the moment) which describes how the feel of the game is so different compared to D&amp;D--and I believe this was something that anyone could spontaneously discover by following the rules, not a product of pure social factors. In other words, just the fact that PCs could be grievously wounded or even killed in one stroke, no matter how experienced they might be, induced a different approach to play and a different focus. Again--provided you followed the rules.<br/><br/>On the other hand I think a lot of the people who choose not to follow the rules (but probably not you, based on what you've written) do so because they come to the game with some sort of preconceived notion which the rules fail to satisfy. Often this is the idea that your character's a big hero right off the bat, or that certain actions ought to succeed because they're flashy and cool, or necessary for a satisfying resolution, when the rules are written from a perspective of neutral cause &amp; effect. Instead of adapting to the rules, they threw them out.<br/><br/>This isn't a specifically Sim thing, by the way--I can say this confidently even though I'm not particularly fond of GNS. Well it's not a Sim thing unless you've decided to define Sim as freeform, rule-less play. Just because you stick to the rules in the areas that they cover, doesn't mean the game can't meander and vary in terms of tone, theme, and area of focus.<br/><br/>A final note, I think the focused/unfocused division, under GNS, is itself subject to misidentification, with Sim being seen as unfocused due to observer bias. The biggest adherents of GNS tend to be soi disant Narrativists who, confronted with a style of game that lacks consistent focus on theme, decided that the game has no focus. When in fact the game may have a very strong focus on such things as the integrity/consistency of the fiction at a factual level, adherence to internal cause-and-effect, playing with certain fictional tropes, engaging with the fiction from a first-person character perspective, etc. However these are things that the observers rate as relatively low importance if they even register at all, so they're overlooked. I think this would be all the more likely if the observer has experienced "incoherent" play by virtue of being the minority "Narrativist" in a game designed for (and played largely by) Sim-leaning players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186469/#Comment_186469" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T05:25:39+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  5:25AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 5:37AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The tools you use knit into drama and storytelling in different ways, enabling certain aspects of a theme to be explored, and disabling others.

As far as I can tell, this is for two primary reasons, all jargon and debate aside.<br/><br/>1. The game only exists as a social construct - rules are ignored or emphasized at the whim of the people at the table, thus what happens at the table is solely their invention.<br/>2. You don't really like rules anyway. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you resemble my girlfriend, who feels that rules are a necessity to avoid narrative deadlock, but basically would rather just sit around telling stories.<br/><br/>Now, I think there's a perspective difference hindering a conclusion of this discussion.<br/><br/>Jon M, have you designed any games? Do you want to?<br/><br/>Game designers pretty much have to believe that system matters, otherwise game design stops being a creative endeavor and starts being just a contest to build the best mousetrap. We are creative people who want to build games that carry our creative stamp.<br/><br/>We're aware that people can take our creations and run with them in different directions - it's not wrong if you find Stephen King unbearably funny, just a little odd - but we try, nonetheless, to create. We create systems that carry style. We create holistic games where the system serves the setting and the setting serves the themes. We do this and believe that it is effective because otherwise, why bother?<br/><br/>Now, you can claim that we're all crazy, but I think it's a matter of point of view. In your group, perhaps you ignore the conventions of play in the book and use the ones in your head. For you, system doesn't matter because you aren't playing the system in the book - you're writing your own, really. However, for a lot of other people - including designers who are trying to create strongly stylish and stylized systems - it does, because that's how we play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186605/#Comment_186605" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T11:30:09+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 11:30AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 12:22PM by timonkey.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>But you're using a printed system.

The character sheet provides numbers and data about the characters that give guidance when determining what happens in conflicts in the game.  It also makes GM rulings seems much more consistent, even when they may not be (I'm not saying they're wrong or bad), because you can point to the book and the character sheet and say, we are playing this game, even if you're really not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186623/#Comment_186623" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T12:21:32+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 12:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 12:22PM by timonkey.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite><br/><br/>The idea of wanting to 'win' a boardgame is quite alien to me.

The idea of not wanting to be beaten by someone who isn't going to do well is just utterly outside my mindset, I wouldn't think in those terms.  I suppose it's a bit like playing a beat em up against someone who holds down the throw button but when that happens to me I see it as a challenge to work around and it can actually prove more interesting than standard beat em up play as that's more about working out how to do certain moves and then doing them again and again in relevant circumstances.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI guess it's different depending on whether you're playing against one or more than one other person.  If only playing against one other person I don't care.  I also agree that boardgames are inconsequential, and I don't care if I lose to someone who's 'not good'.<br/><br/>But I've had issues in games with multiple people, where you're supposed to do X,Y, or Z to get victory points.  Player A decides he's not going to win, so he's going to ignore the rules of the game (try to get victory points) and tries to instead ruin Player B.  Now, instead of Player B and Player C competing to win, Player A has simply decided that he's going to make Player B lose.  Here, to me, Player A is not playing the game.  Player A is supposed to try to get victory points, even if not trying to 'win'.  Player A simply doing W is also not playing the game, even if it doesn't directly affect the other players, because they expect Player A to do X,Y or Z.  It's like playing poker with someone who's trying to get a good cribbage hand.<br/><br/>Side question: do you play boardgames?

I've also run and played Amber which is one step up from a freeform game.  I also run entire sessions where nobody touches their dice and everything is handled by fiat and group discussion when I don't have a clear opinion on a particular matter.<br/><br/>As a player I tend to value character creation rules as a way of helping me to define my character.  Our group uses random chargen quite a bit and I have always found this to be a really helpful way of injecting a baseline to work with.<br/><br/>Similarly I find that the randomised element of RPGs introduces an element of chaos that would not be present were I to just decide everything by fiat.<br/><br/>However, my primary reason for using rules is that I recognise that others see value in them.  I see rules as being a lot like reflexology and acupuncture.  While ultimately I think they have no real effect upon play, I know that some people believe enough in the idea that rules matter that the system of signs and symbols that makes up an RPG can have an impact upon how they perform whilst playing a game.  However, this is not so much about the power of rules to shape play as it is about the power of self-fulfilling prophecies.  As noted above, I think Cthulhu and WFRP are excellent examples of this type of thing as both systems were originally designed for far more heroic types of game.  It isn't WFRP's system that makes it a gritty game about desperately trying to survive, rather it's the set of symbols and signs created by the Enemy Within campaign coupled with people's willingness to read these characteristics into a set of rules that could just as easily be read as being all about heroic adventuring.<br/><br/>Reflexology and Acupuncture work because of the placebo effect and because people are willing to believe that sticking needles in themselves or having their feet rubbed is likely to have an effect upon their well-being.<br/><br/>While I might well have realised that rules are like sugar pills and that it's the mindset of the group that is the real causal agent, other people in my group are not of this belief and so I pay lipservice to their beliefs and allow system to matter to them.<br/><br/>The fact that I am forced, as a GM, to engage with the rules occasionally does also shape which games I play.  I tend to go for invisible systems like BRP or Cinematic Unisystem or (more recently) Over the Edge because they are simple to learn, quick to read and then easily ignored once the game starts.<br/><br/><br/>But Joshua is quite correct.  This is all rather nebulous so I'm happy to leave matters there and simply write up my next session in the terms I am thinking of.

System is Runequest second edition, but with no magic.  Intended feel is sword and sorcery.  PCs hear stuff on roof, run up grabbing weapons but not armour.  Limbs fly through the air with abandon, including PC limbs.  Turns out Runequest second edition without magic is kind of unforgiving on the unarmoured combat front, and after that the players were distinctly averse to getting into fights which was a bit not so sword and sorcery-y.  System impacted play, because the chosen system led mechanically to outcomes at odds with the intended result.  In the same game, I ran a one nighter with two players giving them two minor NPCs to play for a side plot.  We used Savage Worlds, to test drive it.  They waded through opponents in a way that in the main game using RQ2 just couldn't happen.  System again impacted play.<br/><br/>Here's another.  Gangbusters.  For those unfamiliar, careers are classes (Cop, PI, Journalist and so on) and xp is related to activies relevant to that class.  That led to the journalist at one point running past a colleague bleeding out in the street because they knew time was of the essence in phoning the story in.  You get more xp for scoops you see.  The reward mechanic led to behaviour consistent with the setting, the hard boiled hack put the exclusive above all else.  System, impacting play.<br/><br/>Finally, a notional example.  If I want to run a pirates game set in the 18th Century, and I choose DnD as my ruleset, come a couple of levels guns won't work properly in setting as a guy holding a gun on a character is not actually a threat.  They get one shot, you can soak it up without real risk and then lay into them with your sword.  In BRP, you don't charge a guy with a gun if all you have is a sword.  Again, system can directly interfere with intended play goals.<br/><br/>Now, the question then becomes if we accept that system can get in the way, do we just want a system that gets out of the way or do we want one that actively supports our goals?  It depends who we are, I want one that gets out of the way, I strongly dislike actively enabling systems.  Others, particularly the system matters crowd, want systems that actively support, and I wish them every luck in finding such.<br/><br/>I don't really consider any of the above to be theory, if others do that's fine though.  Really it's just that I think saying system doesn't matter isn't right, but simply saying Systerm Matters isn't quite right too as it leaves out all the other stuff which matters far more (and which Jonathan speaks to).<br/><br/>On a last note, if you have a consistent tone you wish from your games.  If you want say rpgs you play to be fun escapist adventure or you want games engines to produce reasonably credible and consistent real world outcomes, then the odds are one system will do for everything you want to play as you have a desired consistency of tone and one engine can probably help (or not hinder) in achieving that tone regardless of the precise setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187065/#Comment_187065" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T05:09:43+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  5:09AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think WFRP mechanically supports its intended play style in two primary ways, the careers mechanic and the critical wounds table.<br/><br/>If I start play as a Rat Catcher or as a Bawd, that's going to lead me away from a more D&amp;D style approach.  If I hit someone, shatter their hip and they bleed out in agony on the floor, that sets a certain tone.  If WFRP was originally designed as heroic, I think it fails in that aim, as a starting PC group may consist of a seer, a labourer, a rat catcher and a servant which doesn't spell heroic fantasy to me.<br/><br/>On a wholly off topic note, acupuncture is I think not thought to be a placebo effect, but an actual one (in part, and in part placebo).  Reflexology I can't speak to.  Homeopathy is pure placebo though so the point holds good still.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187075/#Comment_187075" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T06:40:46+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  6:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

He's saying (based on his examples) that people in general don't necessarily <i>need</i> transparent, codified procedures to roleplay or to have fun doing it.  <i>I do</i>, personally, but there are plenty of people out there who get by just fine without it.

does matter and resolving the outcome of combat is likely to be one of them simply because it's the one aspect of games that pretty much everyone signs up to when they sit down at the table.  A different example might be something like the personality mechanics in Pendragon where people treat them as more or less binding upon their actions depending upon their moods.  Similarly, GMs enforce those rules more or less depending upon their mood or their devotion to the system.<br/><br/>The Zenobia game is actually a good example of what I was thinking of as Runequest is a system where the possibility of a 'total party crippling' is generally counter-acted by healing magics but those parts of the system were not bought into.  Similarly, I thought at the time that one of the reasons why that game was playable was the fact that you tended to grant us initiative so we'd charge people down, do 30 points of  damage with our lances to people's abdomens and the rest would run away or be sucked into a melee where they were outnumbered.  Had we bought into a formal initiative system then I think the game would have been different.  But in either case, the system as written, was only a starting point.  What sculpted the game was the interpretation of that text.<br/><br/>As for WFRP, you can read the game as a completely traditional fantasy RPG : a group of normal people including rat-catchers, bawds and students get sucked into an unpleasant mess  and, after surviving for a while, stop being rat-catchers and start being artillerists or knights or assassins.  It's just a variation on the theme of a lowly peasant or beggar who becomes a great hero.  The game was clearly written with the intention of creating a heroic FRPG but ultimately, the interpretation that presents it as a game in which the working class struggle to survive and to advance socially proved to be more popular in certain circles.  It's the same thing as Call of Cthulhu where the "do adventures, go slowly mad and die" interpretation of the game is radically at odds with the "travel the world, kill monsters with shotguns on a linear fashion" ethos of most of the published adventures.<br/><br/>Rules only ever have the weight that the group gives them.  Ultimately which rules are accepted by the group as having an influence upon their play is determined entirely by social factors.  Those social factors can play out within a session (a person might crack jokes and refuse to let a certain atmosphere take over OR they might go down the 'but my character wouldn't do that' route OR they might not fancy taking down the gnolls this session) or without ('let's play D&amp;D' vs. 'let's play Baron von Munchhausen') but to think that it's the system that is shaping play is like thinking that the tail is wagging the dog... it's confusing the effect with the cause.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187087/#Comment_187087" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T07:28:16+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  7:28AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ludanto --<br/><br/>  I think it's fairly obvious to say that some people don't need rules.<br/><br/>  To take on board your concept, I take calvinballing to be a form of play whereby the rules are constantly changed or re-interpreted.  If so then I think that all roleplaying is calvinballing that takes place not at the level or the game's imaginary space but at the level of the group both in and out of play.  This is because I think that all social interaction is based upon calvinballing.  Rules, as with social structures and political systems are examples of people agreeing on which rules apply to them.  This is not because the rules or the structures have any particular weight but it is rather a reflection of the rather shambolic ways in which humans form views and alliances and make decisions.<br/><br/>  For example, there's no reason why we live in a democracy rather than a theocracy.  I imagine that if key influential people bought into the idea and started defending it and other factors played out across the masses then Number 10 Downing Street would currently be home to the Archbishop of Canterbury.  Under a theocracy, rules such as sufferage and representative officialdom would have as little meaning as Thacos have in My Life With Master.  You can see that in recent American political history where many of the laws constraining official power and protecting the citizenry against its own government were ignored or done away with.<br/><br/>  Life is an endless session of Calvinball.  Values and rules have no weight beyond that granted by popular support and the flows of power.<br/><br/>  So just as I look at human civilisation and think that it is sculpted by human nature, I look at game sessions and think that it is sculpted not by the rules that the group buys into but rather the process of buying in itself and what determines whether or not people buy in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187136/#Comment_187136" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T09:41:53+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  9:41AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So all you're really saying is that the social layer is where system gets decided, and that if there's no intent to arrive at a consistent consensus at the social level, you never actually have a system functioning?

The rules are the definition of what the role to be played is.  The players cannot act outside of these roles without failing at role playing them jsut as a GM cannot be ignorant of the roles he is going to teach.\n<blockquote><b>Games emerge solely from group interaction.

The game itself may "become reality" when played, but that's true of any game anywhere.

At least, they aren't the rules you're using, they aren't system.  System is how the rules are ignored and reinterpreted.  Part of it may also be the lip service you pay toward the supposed rules.<br/><br/>If you live in a country that labels itself a democracy, but essentially is a theocracy, then the political system isn't a democracy, it's a theocracy.

(Or if you want to be pedantic, an objective way of evaluating the purpose. It's well and good to say that the purpose of an RPG is to have fun or tell a good story, but there's no universal and objective concept of either goal.) I can't really speak to RPGs with objective win/loss (or similar) conditions; that might have to come in another reflection, although it's my opinion that, if you have objective win/loss defined for all the participants, you can't also have rigorous mechanics (that is to say, dispense with discretion/"fiat") without turning the activity into a board game. In any case that's all a digression from what Jonathan M is talking about since his games don't have objective win/loss or rigorous mechanics. Both the goal within the game and large portions of "what happens" are socially/subjectively determined.<br/><br/>So: tools. Most tasks can be accomplished using different tools and methods; there's more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to paint the Last Supper. It's an objective fact that you can reproduce the Last Supper as a digital photograph, and therefore it can't be denied that, if someone really wanted to, and had the time, they could create digital paintings from scratch, in the style of Leonardo, which would at least match what you could get by painting them on canvas, wood, or plaster, and then photographing them. Jackson Pollock, too. But people don't, by and large, because the tools available tend to shape the types of expression that are possible.<br/><br/>The same thing is true with RPGs; you can always overrule, ignore, or avoid the rules if you choose. For that matter if the rules contain an escape clause like "rule zero" or "say yes or roll the dice" (note that the latter does make it possible to play an entire game without ever applying the mechanics), you don't even have to say you're bending the rules let alone breaking them. I suppose this would be like creating a new Mona Lisa via a pixel editor: it's doable, yes, but just because it is doable doesn't mean that people won't take advantage of the brush tools, or 3d modelling, rendering, and shading to do something that clearly bears the mark of the new tools.<br/><br/>Why this is, I'm sure I can't describe exhaustively, but several reasons are: because the new tool shapes expression in a manner that's interesting the user, because it's easier to do some things with tool X than tool Y, and because human beings, unlike God, do not have unlimited agency: our conception of what is possible is itself limited and suggested by the tools at hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187494/#Comment_187494" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T21:51:40+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  9:51PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite><b>System does not matter.  Rules do not matter.  Content does not matter.  People matter.</b></blockquote>I guess I read this statement and just wonder why the phrase System Matters is still so controversial. I mean the idea that <b>only </b>people matter in a game strikes me as patently wrong. I'm not saying that any one of those things is primary or that if you play a game with certain systems you're guaranteed to have more fun than other systems because of the design. But a while ago, I picked up a game text called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dogs in the Vineyard</span>, read it and a few of my friends got together and played that game. I would never have had that game experience without that particular book in my hand. Change any factor of that event, the game text, the people, even the time in which we played, and the game changes. Change all the social interactions between the people as we interpreted the text and interacted with each other and the game changes as well. It might have been just as fun, it might have been better for all I know, but it would have been a different experience. And if I think my friend might enjoy a similar game experience about virgin paladin gunslingers in a west that never was, I'm going to suggest he picks up a copy of DiTV. I'm not going to say oh, just use GURPs (nothing wrong with GURPS, mind you) for that and you'll get basically the same thing.<br/><br/>So, does system matter? Of course it does. Does the fact that my reading of a book is a different experience for your reading of the same book mean that the book didn't matter? <br/><br/>Can a games content or rules promote certain kinds of experiences when they interact with actual players around an actual table? That's a good question, and I would say to the extent that the game text is effectively designed as a communication tool and to the extent that it is made part of the system employed by the group, it should tend to have an effect on play in line with the designer's intention. But, Jonathan is right that People Matter. The game is created by the people at the table interacting with system. So, to the extent that the game is poorly designed to its purpose or the group incorporates other rules and techniques (read as "other things they do") the game experience will change too. <br/><br/>Can "non-focused, conflicting games that most gamers engage in" be boatloads of fun? Sure. That's just a matter of taste. It's not broken. It doesn't need fixing as long as the group is getting the fun they want. But system is still mattering there too. The "GMs enforce those rules more or less depending upon their mood or their devotion to the system" technique is part of the system. The players and GM trying to "impose upon the game their expectations for the genre" is system. The fact that part of a system says "say yes, or roll dice!" matters because it tells the group, in this game the GM isn't going to make you roll for things that don't really matter very much. This matters not because rolls that don't matter suck (which they do), but because now the group knows that their agreed upon system includes this provision. <br/><br/>Jonathan, you mention wishing more time was spent understanding unfocused play, but I'm curious what end that would serve? There's tons of games already developed for that style of play and tons of folks playing 'em. Your claim that system and rules don't matter would seem to indicate that any changes to those games aimed at getting more un-focusey or less coherent wouldn't matter anyway. Meanwhile, if I want to make a tightly focused game about loss and sacrifice and death I'm probably going to be well served by doing away with that resurrection spell on page 65.

Instead I think that those factors exist solely at the social level and so attempts to get one type of game rather than another should not be about rules but rather about managing the group.<br/><br/>As for un-focused play, I have never seen a game that gives instructions that truly reflect the nature of gaming.  Either they bracket stuff off as with indie game and start from the "okay, so let's all assume that you've convinced everyone at the table to play the game as written and to subborn their own ideas of fun to that of the game..." or they give some vague instructions as to themes and feel and leave it at that.<br/><br/>If my view of how un-focused play works is correct then there's loads of advice that RPG writers could give in their books.  It wouldn't be rule-based advice it would be more on the level of how to identify patterns of play in your group, how to write adventures for unfocused play (i.e. provide a set of themes and a certain feel but only provide it as a starting point for the players to riff on) and also setting material would have to reflect the fact that different groups are likely to approach the matter from different perspectives.  The Mongoose edition of Paranoia did good work in this respect by catering to different flavours within the game from comic to bleak but I think this should probably be a universal approach to published RPG material.  At least for unfocused games.<br/><br/>As Elliot says, there's plenty that needs to be said about un-focused gaming.  At the moment the more theoretically minded gamers tend to treat it as a dysfunctional style of play that is largely inferior to the more focused style of gaming that has been championed by communities such as this place and The Forge.  A more constructive way of engaging with the way that most people play would be to see it as a style with its own values and tendencies and you can't do that by looking at non-focused gaming as a kind of broken focused gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187528/#Comment_187528" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T05:11:02+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  5:11AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2009 5:13AM by Arminius.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>It wouldn't be rule-based advice it would be more on the level of how to identify patterns of play in your group, how to write adventures for unfocused play (i.e. provide a set of themes and a certain feel but only provide it as a starting point for the players to riff on) and also setting material would have to reflect the fact that different groups are likely to approach the matter from different perspectives.</blockquote>This sounds a bit like Robin's Laws and also Kyle/JimBob's Cheetoism, at least at its base. I seem to recall that Jere Genest also wrote some things along these lines, either in his blog or at the 20x20 room.<br/><br/>Malcolm Sheppard has written a bit about how White Wolf, as a design house, is conscious of the different ways people use RPGs and shapes its designs to accommodate this, but I don't know if they actually put any of that into the GMing/playing advice sections of their books. Recent versions of D&amp;D have at least addressed the issue of "different styles of play" and "different types of player", necessarily at a social level since it's all for the same set of rules (perhaps not surprisingly, given that Robin Laws had a hand in D&amp;D's development). But I would agree that too much "theory" is focused on identifying differences. From what I've read, Laws recommends giving each "player type" a little of whatever he or she likes, as opposed to the "focused gaming" approach which tends to encourage either breaking groups up or, as you suggest, convincing people to play a game which matches the favored style of play of the person doing the convincing. Either would be improved by helping groups work through conflicts and integrate their styles of play--to the extent possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187565/#Comment_187565" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T09:45:05+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  9:45AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>I don't think that rules have a true causal impact upon a game session but that doesn't mean that I don't think that there are causal processes at work changing the outcome of a game.

It's like saying that social interaction is meaningless because everything happens on the biochemical level.  It's true, but it doesn't <i>mean</i> anything.<br/><br/>It's not a game text's place to teach psychology, sociology or whatever.  If a group can't handle itself as a group, then that's not the game's responsibility.  Game's say, "Here's this fun thing, and here's instructions and advice on how to do it".  People will be people, sure, and you can't "make" them do anything by printing up rules, but the rules serve an important function.  They act as a guide to certain types of play, nudging it back to the center if it strays.  Can people decide to ignore those guides?  Of course they can, but then they lose thier benefits.  Can players negotiate that same path without ever bumping up against the sides?  Certainly, but that requires skill and effort from the people that might be better served elsewhere.  Rules are a guide and a shorthand to <i>playing the game</i>.  Of course rules are meaningless out of context, because the rules of a game <i>are</i> the context.<br/><br/>If nothing else, rules are like bumpers in bowling.  They won't guarantee that you'll get a strike, or even knock down many pins, and if you're skilled maybe you don't really need them to score well, and you could even choose to huck the ball into the neighboring lane if you wanted to, but by and large, they'll definitely shape the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187580/#Comment_187580" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T10:46:41+00:00" title="January 11, 2009 10:46AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>It wouldn't be rule-based advice it would be more on the level of how to identify patterns of play in your group, how to write adventures for unfocused play (i.e. provide a set of themes and a certain feel but only provide it as a starting point for the players to riff on) and also setting material would have to reflect the fact that different groups are likely to approach the matter from different perspectives.</blockquote>This sounds a bit like Robin's Laws and also Kyle/JimBob's Cheetoism, at least at its base. I seem to recall that Jere Genest also wrote some things along these lines, either in his blog or at the 20x20 room.<br/><br/><br/>I think that that's a fair comparison.<br/><br/>Robin's Laws are effectively a form of pre-scientific type-theory of personality.  They're like a form of astrology and an attempt to cram a multitude of different types into a rather narrow selection of stereotypes.  However, as I think that all gaming goes on at the level of group dynamics, I think that something like Robin's Laws actually reinvents the wheel.  I suspect that if you looked into some of the work done on group dynamics and personality types in a work situation you'd find that much of the same ground has been covered but in a greater depth.<br/><br/>Robin (if memory serves) breaks players into group according to something similar to creative agenda.  My view of the matter is that what you want out of a game does not determine how you behave at the table, it is your attitude towards groups and your personality that determines how you shape the session.  Whether you want more combat, more plot or more roleplaying is really neither here nor there.<br/><br/>Ludanto is quite correct to point out that I'm talking about levels of explanation.<br/><br/>The key question with different levels of explanation is whether there are emergent properties at your level of resolution that cannot be talked about at a more basic level.  So I think that much theory talk is reinventing the wheel because I don't think it is saying anything that cannot be said in terms of social dynamics.  I think that ultimately all human behaviour will ultimately be described in terms of talk about neurological state but cognitive neuropsychology hasn't quite got round to accounting for all of cognitive and social psychology and so we have to make do with what we have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8388/system-nominalism-me-getting-stuff-out-of-my-head" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8388/system-nominalism-me-getting-stuff-out-of-my-head" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8388/system-nominalism-me-getting-stuff-out-of-my-head/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8388%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8388%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
