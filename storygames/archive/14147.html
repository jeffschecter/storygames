We recently had a Fiascon where a number of people designed Fiasco playsets:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/m3j5jdirh4" rel="nofollow">1890 Shadows of the Empire</a><br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/qkp22x9i0s" rel="nofollow">A Day At The Fair</a><br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/3cgc111lf6" rel="nofollow">Egyptian Expedition</a><br/><br/>There is a groundswell for a further design event and people seem keen to design games.  We would have a 9 hour slot in which to do it with people forming teams (or doing things on their own should they wish).  I want to get a sense of what people here think would be a good task to set the designers.<br/><br/>Should I just let everyone sit down, organise themselves however, and get on with it?<br/>Should I have a set of themes as Game Chef does?<br/>One idea I had was to design a game that could be played within a time limit, such as 15 minutes, half and hour or an hour.  The Meetup Group has been asked somewhat provisionally to run a few tables at the next Dragonmeet in London.  Rrather than plunging those unfamiliar with Indie RPGs/story games straight into something like Polaris I thought that having some short games short games might impart some of the philosophies present in these sorts of games to punters more familiar with D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I don't really need organisational tips.  I'd rather hear from people who design and have attended events like these.  What works?  What falls flat?<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Piers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320812/#Comment_320812" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T12:55:49+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 12:55PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider looking at the videogame Game Jams - they usually run two-three days, but a lot of that time is spent programming, which you could mercifully skip.
