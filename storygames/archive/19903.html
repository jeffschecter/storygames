I thought I would take a real museum (saves me getting the pictures- don't get reimbursed for resources but the mother can print them) and use it make a game. The game idea is she is Katie paranormal investigator and she needs correct these spatial abnormalities by interacting with them to determine their nature. My list of their natures is (1) Want to be her friend (2) Want to be her enemy (3) Have to be fixed (4) Want to fix (5) Need something (6) Need to give her something (7) Buy something from her (8)   Sell her something  <br/>(9) Eat her (10) Be eaten (11) Are annoyed by her (12) Annoying to her <br/><br/>Any ideas about these or more options? <br/><br/>I can make it harder with her being having to evade other people at the museum like security who don't understand her work or easier with me acting as her aide (as well as the "creatures"). She could be involved with the game more by choosing some natures and I choose the creatures that it effects and she chooses the creatures and I choose the natures. <br/><br/>Any thoughts on this whole concept? <br/>I could have a more open story but she more used to games with a clear end.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440717/#Comment_440717" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-07T20:30:14+00:00" title="December  7, 2014  8:30PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try inspectres?

How about 325 to 750 students every year, aged 10 to 15.  I've had success with a more complicated game with groups of eight to ten 14 and 15 year old Chinese EFL students.  But if I was going to do the same thing again (and I probably will soon),  I would use something like Pocket Danger Patrol.  It would be an easier solution to your needs.  The structure of the game is laid out almost exactly like you describe the challenges and results from your para-normal museum adventure.  If you take a look at Pocket Danger Patrol, it can be re-skinned to be the game that you're describing above in your initial post.  I think it would work fine for solo-adventuring.<br/><br/>If the students were older <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> had more second-language, linguistic resources, I would choose more of a oracle-game like Ghost/Echo, although I wouldn't use that particular setting.  And I might tweak it so that it is more forgiving to the players.  A Ghost/Echo styled game would be awesome for high intermediate to advanced EFL students because there is some much creative speaking required to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440851/#Comment_440851" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T09:50:06+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  9:50AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How old is your student, btw?</blockquote> I just realized you were asking the OP.
