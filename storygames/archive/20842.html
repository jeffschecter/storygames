There are three players.<br/><br/>I threw together a tense, tricky situation and a handful of NPCs with strong drives but not the ability to get themselves out of trouble. Then I told the players to come up with characters who fit into that and want to change it: the most important players in this mess.<br/><br/>My approach to this kind of gaming is to create a mess, and then follow the PCs trying to accomplish their goals. (With a game system which allows them to do so, but at a cost, some interesting drama follows quite naturally.)<br/><br/>What I got back from them was a little... passive. Two, in particular, are basically just trying to preserve the status quo. They're not powerfully pursuing goals, or unsure of what to do.<br/><br/>As a result, when we ended the first session, I realized:<br/><br/>*My NPCs are far more interesting and active characters right now than the PCs.*<br/><br/>That felt really strange, and uncomfortable. I can do the thing where the GM brings the fuel to the table, and pushes the game along, while the players react... but I haven't done it in many years, and I don't really *want* to. I'd rather be reacting to the players, as I have generally been doing for the past some odd years.<br/><br/>Do you have any clever advice on how I might approach the second session of this game?<br/><br/>I am happy to hear advice anywhere on the spectrum from A to B:<br/><br/>* The players want to be passengers in your story. You should take the game in firm hand, come with a plot, and drive it forward full-on.<br/><br/>* Put away everything you have and throw the game in the players' lap; tell them nothing happens except for what they pursue.<br/><br/>Anything within that range or beyond it, along with a practical method of putting it into practice, is welcome.<br/><br/>What would you do? <br/><br/>What have you always wanted to try (even if you never got the chance)?<br/><br/>How would you go about it?<br/><br/>Feel free to ask for any details you'd like, as well.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457562/#Comment_457562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T17:47:11+00:00" title="October 27, 2016  5:47PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have any good advice except for the 20/20 hindsight of "You probably shouldn't have accepted those passive sounding characters if you didn't want a game where you feed the fun to the characters."

This is not uncommon in certain types of fiction, e.g. fantasy literature - many well-known heroes of the genre are specifically passive people who experience things done to them, and perhaps rise to the occasion at the very of the story. Consider Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, or Thomas Covenant, or all the children in all the Narnia books: they're all just like your player characters.<br/><br/>So what you do is, you let the NPCs set the agenda: Gandalf tells the PCs what he wants them to do. Then you bring complications, dragons or whatever. But then, Gandalf dies midway through while fighting a balrog, and now they're on their own, and new information emerges - Gandalf's plan is now impossible or undesirable. They have to make their own choices!<br/><br/>Or, Gandalf <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> comes in from stage left, and he wants them to do the very opposite of what Gandalf <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> wanted, because we're shades of grey now. Note that this is an entirely ordinary narrativist arrangement, the PCs being passive doesn't change anything, really; it just means that the NPCs are slightly more proactive about demanding action from them, instead of merely hinting at the possibilities. A knight protector who merely wants to protect the status quo can still be the center of dramatic action when they are forced to choose between their loyalty to the king, and their loyalty to the queen.<br/><br/>Note that you don't need to prep a plot, just the NPCs who want things, and who need the PCs to do these things for them. It is interesting enough, speaking of play content, if you have three interesting NPCs come and beg the PCs for help in turn; it lets the players participate by answering a multiple-choice question, and it's drama when you portray those NPCs asking them for help. After the choice you simply portray the consequences of the choice, and that's the game.<br/><br/>This all actually smacks a lot of <i>Fables of Camelot</i>. It's a sort of a beginner game, so I see a lot of player passivity when running it. Hasn't been a problem, really; I just need to be interested enough in the subject matter to portray lots of NPCs and let them do stuff to provoke the players, and sooner or later they start to make their own stands - either I hit a compelling button (often something the player didn't realize would work in advance - flags are a flawed tool), or the player gets comfortable and confident enough to start actually reacting and doing things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457568/#Comment_457568" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T19:16:41+00:00" title="October 27, 2016  7:16PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed.  This is damage control, trying to put the ball back into the Players' hands.  I'd probably start writing a check that the NPC can't cash.  It has to be something the PCs want too.  Ramp up the tension.  Then kill or neutralize the key NPC in the midst of it.  The "death" of Gandalf is a great example: "Fly, you fools!"  Another option is to have the NPC(s) get captured during the attempt, and now the PCs are the only ones who can save them.  But ramp up the tension first.  They're going to need as much energy as you can pump into the scene.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457569/#Comment_457569" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T19:45:15+00:00" title="October 27, 2016  7:45PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent advice! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's... hmmm. How can I put this?<br/><br/>What you are describing is more or less what I'm doing now.<br/><br/>I have a few active, passionate NPCs who want to change things, and are in trouble. (For example, one is a young woman who has been promised to a very questionable and grotesque individual as a "virgin bride". She's quite unhappy about this, and not taking it lying down. So far, she went and burned down the town church.)<br/><br/>I've quite intentionally given the NPCs strong desires, but not the ability to accomplish their goals by themselves.<br/><br/>The techniques you're describing are excellent - more or less what I've been planning to do:<br/><br/>* Keep the pressure on<br/>* Have active NPCs, who destabilize the situation<br/>* Contrive to have the PCs in the middle of it, as prime deciders/movers/actors<br/><br/>The question becomes whether I should crank that up to the max, or look for a different approach.<br/><br/>This technique works, as I know from past experience, but I'm looking to see if I can try something different, for a change in pace. It might be fruitless goal! But I'd like to explore some alternatives and see where that takes me.<br/><br/>I could also take advantage of your patience and the Story Games brain-trust and describe the situation some, and take your opinions on where to take it next. Putting other people's ideas into practice would be fun for me, too, for a change of pace.<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>Do you have any specific approach to having that conversation you were describing? Somehow, in this situation, I feel like I would be putting myself upon the players. My intuition says that they feel busy and, while they're prepared to engage the game full-on, they're not interested in giving it too much thought *before* the game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457570/#Comment_457570" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T20:28:19+00:00" title="October 27, 2016  8:28PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, Paul, that what folks are suggesting is going a step beyond what you are saying your are doing.

Burning down a church isn't any good unless one of the PCs is the priest.  <br/><br/>Have the NPC approach the PCs to kill her husband to be. Or smuggle her out of town. Or turn her into a newt.

Or smuggle her out of town. Or turn her into a newt. Or whatever the PCs might be good at.   Or have the husband to be work with them to ensure everything goes smoothly and no one 'spoils' his bride.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is *excellent* advice. Unfortunately, it's also precisely what I'm doing. Like I said, it DOES work, and I've done it plenty before.<br/><br/>I'm just... sitting here and realizing that, going into the second session, I don't have any of those thoughts I like to have: "Oh, man! I wonder what PC 2 is going to do now?"<br/><br/>Instead, it's all like the above: "Ok, what will NPC 3 do now to make a mess of things for the PCs?" "I wonder what Ioana is going to do next?"<br/><br/>For instance: "Have the NPC approach the PCs to kill her husband to be."<br/><br/>This is awesome! (And I'll probably use it - it's a very natural next step for what's happened so far.) However, it's still something that I'm bringing forward and putting into play. It's me saying to the players: "Hey! Here's a thing you have to react to!"<br/><br/>I was prepared to start the first session that way (and I did). I was hoping that, by the end of the first session, the dynamic would have shifted to the PCs doing that stuff, and ME reacting. <br/><br/>I find myself wishing that, going into the second session, I'd have players jumping up and down, because, man oh man, they have a burning need to do <i>this thing</i>! Instead, here I am back to coming up with fun stuff for my NPCs to do.<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations are unrealistic. Perhaps the players are just more passive types, or they still need more time to feel comfortable being more active.<br/><br/>But I feel like there might be a clever way to spin things around, to approach this another way. Like, I can almost imagine it, but not quite see the whole picture.<br/><br/>Maybe there's a clever way to get them to put voice to some powerful needs or goals for their characters? Before the session, or during the session?<br/><br/>I like Eero's suggestion of contriving things so that the decision-making power falls to one of the PCs. I can just put them in more and more powerful positions, have more and more people defer to them, until it comes down to what they choose to do.<br/><br/>I also really like BeePeeGee's suggestion to have them play the NPCs. It could almost work here! I don't think it actually will, though - the players are pretty attached to their characters, by this point. But it's a really good thought; I like how it plays with assumptions and shakes things up.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457575/#Comment_457575" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T22:39:21+00:00" title="October 27, 2016 10:39PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2016 10:39PM by AsIf.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some players sit in one spot and let things come to them.  That can work fine, if they're in a spot that's ripe for continual drama.  And some people are stoic.  That's okay too, if they dig that, you just have to play for subtle drama and a slow-build.  My Apoc Vegas crew was a lot like this.  What eventually drew them out of their safehole was realizing that offscreen, the world was moving and Fronts were taking up position and making alliances all around them, and they were about to be the only faction on the map who didn't have their hand in the regional power game.  But it unfolded very slowly, taking six sessions before they made a move on the city map.  That may just be their speed.  If so, you might play into inter-character drama (even P2P drama) and let it become more of an emotional tale than a physical one.<br/><br/>If you're still itching to pull a move, here are another few quick thoughts, although I don't know your players so I can't advise on which might work better...<br/><br/>- abandon them.  Now they have to think on their own.<br/><br/>- approach as another NPC who plants seeds of doubt about the first NPCs, or have the PCs discover something that implies their NPCs are not what they seem.  Why are they *really* hanging with us?  Foster conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>- attack with a powerful force or disaster that even the other NPCs are unprepared for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457576/#Comment_457576" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T22:40:39+00:00" title="October 27, 2016 10:40PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Tod!

I think we might have more luck with  generating more specific advice and ideas given more background into the game itself.<br/><br/>I'll start by being as brief as I can, and feel free to ask more details about any given thing.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>*The Background Situation*<br/><br/>The general setting is a vaguely Dark Ages-fantasy-Europe place, just outlined in very broad strokes. (It's been hinted at more than actually defined.)<br/><br/>There is a town named Verhoven, small, distant, isolated. Originally built as a military outpost, it survives now only because of its iron mine (which is operating still, just barely). It is far from the capital of the kingdom, or the King's rule, on the edge of a swamp.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago, it was ruled by the Varga family. However, the head of the family became involved with one of the King's bastard sons. The King was none too happy about this, arrested the Varga, and threw him in a dungeon.<br/><br/>The village has been run, since then, by a small group of Royal Guardsmen, who stepped in to replace the Vargas. They also brought in some Tchegarans (dark-skinned folks from the South, who are considered unclean and rumoured to consort with the devil - typical medieval casual racism, quite nasty) to work at the mine.<br/><br/>At the present time, however, the head of the Varga has been released from the King's dungeons and is en route back to Verhoven, along with all his other Varga relatives.<br/><br/>The problem? There has not been any kind of official statement from the Crown about, well, who's supposed to be in charge now.<br/><br/>This means that the town is effectively separated into four groups:<br/><br/>* The Guardsmen. They've been ruling the town for twenty years, and aren't exactly keen to see the Vargas return - the scrupulous few stay at the Keep, but many have been living in Varga mansions and spending Varga wealth to give themselves a very comfortable lifestyle for two decades now.<br/><br/>* The Villagers. The locals mostly want segregation: to keep their lives separate from the Tchegarans, and have  forced them to make their own burial grounds in the swamp (so as not to defile the town's cemetary with their dead). Some side with the Guardsmen while others look forward to the Vargas' return.<br/><br/>* The Vargas. They are coming back and expecting to run the place once more. Of course, they'd like to see everything back to "normal" and the Guardsmen turn into their servants or sent home.<br/><br/>* The Tchegarans. Horribly oppressed, they tentatively see the Vargas as potential saviours, and want to share in the wealth of the town (rather than continue being ostracized) as well as to see the Guardsmen out of here. They are forced to live outside the town in a little village made up of huts, and aren't supposed to be found in the town after dark. <br/><br/>The above was pretty much all my prep. The rest (below) is mixed up, mostly my ideas but with stuff thrown in by the players (some before play, during character creation - I asked them to create NPCs and tie themselves to them - and some during play; for instance, the Guard Captain made up the idea of the nightly curfew).<br/><br/>Notable NPCs:<br/><br/>* <b>The Governor</b>. Head of the Guardsmen, she seems to have lost it somewhat in recent times, is reclusive, and rarely seen outside the Keep. Every time she *is* seen, she looks paler and paler. (She's been ignored so far, but I figure she is plotting against the Vargas.)<br/><br/>* <b>Ina, the Preacher</b>. Her church has been burned down, and she wants to see the Varga wealth used to rebuild it and the Tchegarans responsible punished. (Of course it was Tchegarans! Who else would burn down the church?!?) She is growing more and more desperate. She is also the baker's sister (a PC).<br/><br/>* <b>Oolma</b>, a spooky, wizened old woman. She is a sort of village Elder whose authority the Tchegarans recognize.<br/><br/>*<b> Ioana</b>, Ina the Preacher's young daughter. She has been promised to the head of the Varga family (rumoured to be a monster) via a long-ago compact... as a sort of virgin bride. (She is the one who burned down her mother's church, although only <b>Mekha</b> knows this so far.)<br/><br/>* <b>Mekha</b>, a Tchegaran orphan who has been de facto a foster child of the baker's (a PC). Since this isn't strictly legal, he has to be kept secret from the Guards. He is in love with Ioana and is prepared to take the fall for the burning of the church for her.<br/><br/>There is also a "postmaster", Gustav, who is important to Giancarlo (PC), since he provides the only connection to his family. I haven't found a good way to bring him in yet.<br/><br/>PCs:<br/><br/>* <b>Giancarlo</b>, the Guard Captain. He's the second-in-command after the Governor, and obsessed with obeying the letter of the law. He doesn't care about any of the locals, and is just looking forward to going home. He (or his men) killed <b>Luca</b>'s wife in an altercation years ago, and now (ironically, or horribly) Giancarlo holds Luca reponsible for this! He is committed to causing trouble for Luca, and, in the first session, broke into his shop and destroyed all the mead, out of pure malice.<br/><br/>Keys:<br/><br/>"Ladder-Climber" (benefits when he improves his own situation)<br/>"Personal Enmity" (benefits when he acts maliciously towards Luca)<br/><br/>* <b>Luca</b>, the baker. His shop is the most important place in town, largely because he has been selling mead to the Guards. (This is illegal, and <b>Giancarlo</b> hates him for it.)<br/><br/>Keys:<br/><br/>"Varga Supporter" (Luca feels very loyal to the Vargas)<br/>"Orphan's Guardian" (he is a guardian to <b>Mekha</b>, like <i>Key of the Guardian</i> from the original TSoY)<br/><br/>* <b>Sergio</b>, a grizzled army veteran and deserter who has been hiding in Verhoven to escape justice. He fled the army after killing a young Tchegaran boy during a military action, and desperately craves forgiveness from them, in some form or another.<br/><br/>Recently this has taken the form of him protecting <b>Mekha</b> from the Guards (by force of arms!). He had to give up his secret identity to do so, and is now a wanted man.<br/><br/>Keys:<br/><br/>* "Revolutionary" (like the TSoY Key; benefits by acting out against the authorities)<br/>* "Murderer's Guilt" (benefits by helping a Tchegaran or putting his trust in their hands)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I rather like the setup, because it was interesting how each character aligned in different ways with the main power blocs in the town.<br/><br/>I created a few of the details with this in mind, like Ioana and her mother being clearly against the arrival of the Vargas (putting Luca's loyalty to them in question).<br/><br/>Just writing this out has helped a good deal, and is giving me some ideas. I had to prepare for this game in a bit of a rush, and just putting this together is helpful (as a form of public prep).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457580/#Comment_457580" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T23:41:33+00:00" title="October 27, 2016 11:41PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2016 11:51PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <b>first session</b> involved mounting hostilities between <b>Luca</b> and <b>Giancarlo</b>, and <b>Sergio</b> getting involved in the Mekha/Ioana/church burning storyline.<br/><br/>It ended with Sergio passed out in Mekha's bedroom after getting knifed by Ioana (he jumped her from behind, and decided that one of the dangers was her injuring him in self-defense, then failed the roll magnificently). Luca, with his heart of gold, patched him up and saved his life.<br/><br/>However, just then the guards broke into the bakery and found them all there. Mekha, terrified, jumped out of the window, and has been arrested by the guards. It was a bit of a cliffhanger ending! (Not intentional; our time was up, and it seemed like a good place to stop.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The <b>rules</b> we are using are basically those from my game, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20513/thus-began-the-adventures-of-eowyn" rel="nofollow">Thus began the Adventures...</a>, with a couple very slight modifications to make them non-Lord-of-the-Rings specific.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The <b>players</b> are two of my colleagues and a less well-known friend.<br/><br/>The two colleagues are both fairly new to this:<br/><br/>* Sergio's player is completely new to games of this sort, and really enjoying story gaming. <br/>* Luca's player (the only girl in our group, and the hostess) has played a bit of D&amp;D, but still finds this all new and exciting. The three of us previously played my game <i>Musette</i> and then <i>Fiasco</i>, which <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20802/a-happy-fiasco" rel="nofollow">we had some minor trouble with</a>. However, our creative dynamic feels quite good: we have a good chemistry when playing and the exchange is good. <br/>* Giancarlo's player, however, is relatively unknown to us but an experienced gamer (and told me he has GMed a lot of traditional games, from D&amp;D to Call of Cthulhu). This is the first time he's played with us.<br/><br/>Sergio and Luca's players engaged very fully with the game, and are happy to take risks for their characters (especially Sergio's, as you can see!). I can't get a good read on Giancarlo's player, though.<br/><br/>This is one of the things I'm finding challenging (see "*" above for an example). Giancarlo takes his post as Guard Captain seriously, but deals with everything in a very organized fashion. Usually, instead of getting personally involved, he will send his guards to carry out his commands (e.g. to arrest Mekha), and I have no clear sense of what he cares about (except for causing trouble and eventually leaving the town and getting back to his family, which has been difficult for me to bring into play directly).<br/><br/>The most glaring omission, to my eyes (based on what I talked about with the players before playing) has been the whole postmaster angle. Ideally I really need to tie Gustav in to the developing drama so as to get Giancarlo more personally involved with what's happening, I think. I find "I rely on him to deliver my mail" to be a bit thin, dramatically speaking, but that's all I could get from the player so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457582/#Comment_457582" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T23:54:13+00:00" title="October 27, 2016 11:54PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also, Rafu, it's fun to have you here commenting on my game after we have done so much back-and-forth on yours!

This might be the key to an exciting game: using PC-NPC-PC triangles, you can nudge PCs - individually or in unlikely pairs - to act against other PCs, directly or indirectly.<br/><br/>Giancarlo looks very easy to push. I'd either make the Governor a very strong presence in Giancarlo's life, demanding things of him he'd rather not do... or do away with her at once, leaving Giancarlo in charge, and the first person the Varga will have to speak to as soon as they're back in town. Either way, he's going to have more pressing thoughts than Luca's moonlight mead. Also, doesn't he have the arson of a church to investigate and a manhunt to run?<br/>As soon as Giancarlo's busy with the big political picture, I'd use some NPC to offer Luca a chance to retaliate against him. Sergio's obvious conflict is whether to run from the guards or to stay and help save Mekha, but maybe there's something less obvious as well...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457584/#Comment_457584" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T00:22:00+00:00" title="October 28, 2016 12:22AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2016 12:22AM by Paul_T.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff thus far!

'I don't care about anybody, I just follow the letter of the law*, and my primary desire is literally to leave the place the story is occurring.' My first impulse would be to like 'cool, Giancarlo, you get sent home -- new character!' because what the heck is that. Things improve only marginally with 'oh and I really hate the baker', but still. Geez.<br/><br/>*i.e. I can portray all of my actions as outside my own agency and/or responsibility.<br/><br/>Barring that, my suggestion would be to immediately alter his situation in a way that makes 'just want to go home' a clearly absurd/impossible notion. One possibility, already suggested, is getting the Governor out of the picture ASAP. <br/><br/>Personally, my suggestion would be to bring whatever it is Giancarlo wants to 'go home to' <i>here</i>, to Verhaven. This assumes he has a family or wife or child or sister -- when whatshisface Vargas arrives from the capital? Guess who he brought with him. 'Giancarlo, you'll be so happy to see -- your lovely wife is here! And your beautiful new child! I knew how lonely you must have been' etc. etc. If this was something the Vargas faction was capable of, it would clearly be an immensely powerful political maneuver, especially since it simultaneously acts as an attempt to curry favour and a BYOL (bring your own leverage) maneuver in terms of negotiations with the Guards. (If you wanted a more ominous version, they could just bring family members of ALL or most of the guardsmen.)<br/><br/>Of course, if Giancarlo also doesn't care about anybody 'back home' (what the fuck, Giancarlo), this won't work. In that case I would suggest providing him with many opportunities to advance his station that also require him to commit to never going home. The death of his superior would presumably do this, but so would some sort of offer from the Vargas group, or similar.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457597/#Comment_457597" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T03:31:09+00:00" title="October 28, 2016  3:31AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">@IceCreamEmperor</a>:<br/><br/>Now that is GOLD, my friend! <br/><br/>I couldn't agree more with your assessment of Giancarlo, and your suggested solutions are... dang, yeah!

I don't think system is the sole solution to this problem since there's a major social component to it, but fine tuning the system might give the players more focus for playing their characters. <br/><br/>In my experience keys lead to more passive play than beliefs because keys don't have as clear and concrete player-written short term goals to go for. Of course they have goals and direction, but keys lack the current context in concrete terms. Maybe you could get the players to write goal oriented key scenes for themselves? Perhaps first at the start of a session and then updating them at the end if you want to react to their new goals in your prep. This would make them analyze what they really want to accomplish in the current situation, and give you an opportunity to guide them toward impactful, immediate goals.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457602/#Comment_457602" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T08:50:33+00:00" title="October 28, 2016  8:50AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Good stuff thus far! I'm in agreement. What kinds of things do you think the Governor could ask Giancarlo to do? I'm not 100% clear and what he cares about, so the first thing that comes to mind is anything which undermines the Guards' standing (for example, doing absolutely un-Guardsman-like things, like assassinating the Varga or turning the town over to the Tchegarans or something equally bizarre).<br/><br/>An ideal outcome would be something which would deprive Giancarlo of his status or standing, since that could work for or against his Key, or he could choose to rebel, instead.<br/></blockquote>\nSomething which goes against "the letter of the law", for sure. Something which could cost him his status <i>if it became known in the capital</i> - but disobeying the Governor means a temporary, immediate loss of status in town. Whichever way he acts, take any opportunity to have an NPC or PC witness it. If he rebelled against the Governor, he could very well win, but the support and loyalty of other Guardsmen comes at a cost - that cost probably being a compromise of some kind.\n<blockquote>Maybe the Governor is stark raving mad, and he's next in line to replace her, which is a posting for life?</blockquote>\nPosting for life or not, if the Governor is unfit to be a Governor, her second-in-command has to act as Governor ad interim until a new one is nominated. That's both an opportunity for career advancement and a pain in the ass.<br/>I especially like this option because it makes Giancarlo into the "hardholder", and I know a hardholder's life is always, by definition, "interesting" (uhm).<br/><br/>By this metric, BTW, Luca looks like a Maestro D' (or Operator) and it's my experience that Hardholder and Maestro D' are better off being friends, because when they aren't (it happens!) their conflicts ramp up quickly and easily turn deadly.<br/>I'd actually have a look at the hardholder and maestro playbooks for suggestions of trouble to throw at them... or, even better, suggestions of how to build an infrastructure around each of them which invites trouble.\n<blockquote>Sergio and Luca seem to be on the same side so far, so I'll need to find a way to wedge a Tchegaran/Varga problem between them... </blockquote>\nI think the most obvious wedge to hammer between them is Ina: to Sergio, a xenophobic nutjob and a danger to Mekha - but to Luca, she's a sister! Have Ina ask Luca to choose between fraternal loyalty to her and paternal love of Mekha - in her mind those can't coexist, not anymore - then have her escalate her hate of the Tchegaran to some action Sergio can't ignore.\n<blockquote>The most glaring omission, to my eyes (based on what I talked about with the players before playing) has been the whole postmaster angle. Ideally I really need to tie Gustav in to the developing drama so as to get Giancarlo more personally involved with what's happening, I think. I find "I rely on him to deliver my mail" to be a bit thin, dramatically speaking, but that's all I could get from the player so far.</blockquote>\nI think "letter from home" could be a great venue to hint at bits of a larger world, including political trouble in the kingdom. You can use letters from Giancarlo's family - or colleagues - to <i>announce future badness</i>, showing some kind of larger front in action, like a distant storm. You have no reason to care for preserving the status quo in the capital, the kingdom or the world, BTW... If something huge is happening elsewhere, its ripples may reach Verhoven. Maybe Giancarlo's immediate family announce they're joining him in Verhoven because they're <i>safer</i> there... You can also use letters to convey other details about the world you've happened to daydream.\n<blockquote>This is one of the things I'm finding challenging (see "*" above for an example). Giancarlo takes his post as Guard Captain seriously, but deals with everything in a very organized fashion. Usually, instead of getting personally involved, he will send his guards to carry out his commands (e.g. to arrest Mekha), and I have no clear sense of what he cares about (except for causing trouble and eventually leaving the town and getting back to his family, which has been difficult for me to bring into play directly).</blockquote>\nAnother thing I'm thinking is, maybe this <i>isn't</i> something you actually have to deal with. Try one of the (many) Giancarlo-facing suggestions mentioned in this thread so far, but if he doesn't bite the hook, don't push it, and don't put <i>all</i> the focus on him. The player has experience, you say: before concluding he doesn't know how to have fun (admittedly, the possibility exists) let's work from the assumption he knows what he's doing, for one or two more sessions. By making such an unlikeable character, not providing any glimpses on his inner life but being a bully toward another PC instead, it's entirely possible he's painting himself into a "villain" corner on purpose. Thing is, that can actually be a fun role to play, as any GM knows well! As long as he's interacting with other PCs - by opposing them - and they're all liking it, everything is working fine, even if no redeeming qualities ever emerge in Giancarlo to make him a protagonist.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457608/#Comment_457608" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T15:15:33+00:00" title="October 28, 2016  3:15PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of good thoughts, thanks!

It shows you how to establish dramatic poles within your character and dramatic tensions between the characters.<br/><br/>As for PC-NPC-PC triangles, you could bring in a new NPC that changes and challenges the status quo and dynamic between the PCs. E.g. maybe the king sends out a delegation with entirely new plans for Verhoven. Maybe a general shows up and wants the local people to join a war (that none of the local groups are interested in).<br/><br/>Personally, I would find an outside challenge interesting, forcing the different factions to cooperate.<br/><br/>I really like your setting and find it very interesting. What I'm asking myself is if the players did buy into the setting. Also, are there enough empty spaces in the setting to be filled out by the players' imagination?<br/>There is a certain risk of mapping out a detailed setting in <i>your</i> imagination.

Two, in particular, are basically just trying to preserve the status quo. They're not powerfully pursuing goals, or unsure of what to do.</blockquote>\nI notice I do this in games where I haven't really connected with the setting and/or premise -- basically, just treading water and hoping that something genuinely interesting will float to the top. <br/><br/>If it's a setting problem, I might work it out when I get a firmer sense of what a reasonable goal within that setting would look like, or what's actually fun to do during play, what kinds of consequences follow particular actions, which losses are recoverable and which lead to a death spiral, etc.. It's basically a problem with uncertainty: when I don't know what's supposed to work and I feel like taking uninformed actions would be irresponsible and potentially damage someone else's fun, then I feel like I need to be more of an observer.<br/><br/>If it's a problem connecting with the premise, whether I ever work it out depends mostly on what I get from other people at the table. A few likable characters (PCs or NPCs) and a few ones I really like to hate might be enough, or maybe a charismatic alpha player with plans to spare for everyone, or some flexibility in the premise that lets me dig in a claw and drag the game more towards an area I <i>do</i> connect with. I'll cling desperately to anything fun that anyone waves in my direction and hope that the focus of the game stays on that, basically, but if I don't get that, then I just retreat to a more 'utility player' role and try to move the spotlight away from me onto other players.<br/><br/><br/>Curiously, I run into one particular problem all the time with NPCs connected to my PC during character creation; something about the combination of being asked to invent an NPC on the spur of the moment combined with how someone else plays that NPC in the actual game usually creates a character I really don't enjoy talking to or interacting with. It must be the mismatch between my internal half-formed image of who that person is and the portrayal given back to me by someone who's following their own internal casting director's advice that sets my teeth on edge. And obviously, that might not be what's happening in your game at all, but you might still consider driving every NPC you've got like a stolen car -- I'm assuming that they're not meant to be permanent fixtures in the PCs' lives or in the game, so you might as well keep wrecking them and bringing in new ones until you find a set that works.<br/><br/><br/>edit: oh wait, I have a piece of actual concrete advice to offer!<br/><br/>Do everything in your power to avoid having an NPC start off with a big ask, it rarely works well. They should ask for help with something easy first -- something very much in the PC's wheelhouse, something that takes little effort and poses little risk, something that doesn't have a lot of strings attached to it. It's not just about giving them some room to establish personality and a relationship with the PCs instead of coming off as an immediately aggravating, problem-spewing quest monkey, it's also good psychology: just as in real life, getting a small favor from someone makes them much more likely to do a big favor for you later on. (Plus, the low stakes and negligible risk of an easy task can give hesitant players a chance to try things without feeling like they're ruining something.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457656/#Comment_457656" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-30T00:06:21+00:00" title="October 30, 2016 12:06AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2016 12:06AM by Paul_T.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>That's surprising to hear! The amount of thought you put in the multi-faction setup and the parallels with Shadow of Yesterday had me thinking of indefinite-length campaign play.<br/></blockquote>\nNot untrue! The setup is fairly short/simple (it's basically everything in my description up until the line "Notable NPCs", after which everything was a joint/collaborative effort), but it's something I've used before, and, since I was short on time, I decided to use it again. So I can draw on things which happened the last time I used the same scenario for inspiration (that's where the burning of the church came from, for example).<br/><br/>I had no idea whether the players would be interested in something long-term, so I decided to pitch something which could play it a quick climax or be drawn out into longer play. So far, it seems like they want to continue and stretch it out! But who knows for how long; we're just starting to play together, and I don't know how often we'll be able to get together or what the interest level is like so far. At this point we just went from "let's play one session, to see if we like it" to "hey, that was fun - let's plan two more sessions for this game".<br/><br/>BeePeeGee, I like the idea of bringing in an outside source of tension/pressure. I wonder if I don't already have too many balls in play, however? My instinct here is, rather, to consolidate and to reincorporate as much as possible, drawing everything tighter. (Then again, and outside source of trouble *could* do that, too, in a different way.)<br/><br/>Lots of other good thoughts. NPCs can be a surprise, indeed, and so I am always curious what reaction the players will have to them. Good advice on avoiding the "big ask" before something else has been established! My NPCs are very, very "throwaway" - I'm more than happy to see them dashed on the rocks of the PCs' passions (I just hope they find some).<br/><br/>Sergio and Luca seem to have a heroic side to them, which is fantastic for what we're doing. Sergio almost got himself killed in the first session, after all! Giancarlo is more of a problem, but the suggestion to bring his family to him in some way has got me excited about the game again. <br/><br/>Right now, I'm planning to start the second session with Giancarlo receiving a letter from his family... and then ask him about them. Perhaps we'll play out a little "flashback", to see what his relationship to his family is like. Then, if it seems appropriate, the letter can turn out to have some bad news: and, depending on what he tells me about his family, I'll throw something into the game which plays off that. Perhaps they are arriving with the Vargas, or someone *pretending to be them* is, or someone persecuting them... whatever seems like it will be interesting to the player.<br/><br/>If I can get Giancarlo on the wagon, so to speak, then the game seems exciting and interesting to me again.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457806/#Comment_457806" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T18:33:57+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  6:33PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2016 6:47PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read the whole thread Paul so forgive me if this approach has been covered. My number one suggestion would be to talk to your players about your expectations, so that you are on the same page.<br/><br/>Also, you might just bite the bullet and do some things you don't want to do in a way you can stand to do them, for the payoff of long term rewards. I have noticed that gamers traditionally expect the GM to take on the vast majority of work when it comes to plot, world building, and especially providing a context for players to take initiative in the story. When I first started and was used to the D&amp;D model it took me a while to adjust to the type of model you are using. They may just need time to get used to the new rules and approach; they also may need more guidance and a sort of training wheel approach. I would continue asking leading questions and easing them in to the new style if you have the patience for it.

The third session is coming up, and I really don't feel like I have to do much - I can just show up and have my NPCs react to what the PCs are doing. This is a much better feeling for me.<br/><br/>The rules have been doing a fantastic job - this is quickly becoming one of my favourite rulesets. <br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>Sergio, an army deserter, arranges an escape from the keep by climbing through the storm drain (which empties into the swamp). Because of the way the game rules work, there were many interesting choices for him to make: he punched the kid he was trying to rescue (Mekha) in order to convince him to cooperate with his own rescue, and then pushed Ioana down the drain, causing her to break her ankle.<br/><br/>This allowed him to successfully pull off quite an impressive jailbreak, but at the cost of potentially making enemies out of the very people he cares about, and changing our perception of his character (up until now, a noble and self-sacrificing sort). It turns out he's capable and willing to go quite a long ways for something he believes to be necessary!<br/><br/>We also learned in a flashback that he is not only responsible for the death of one Tchegaran (the young scout he killed), but killed several others in cold blood under the orders of his merciless Lance Captain (who wished to keep his own hands clean). This adds quite a bit of depth to our Sergio; he's becoming quite a nuanced character.<br/><br/>Luca turns out to have quite a interesting relationship with Ina, who committed herself to the church when her husband died, and thereby forced a wedge between her and her brother (that's Luca).<br/><br/>Lots happened:<br/><br/>The Vargas have arrived, accompanied by mercenaries disguised as servants, and are keen to reclaim their position as the rulers of the town.<br/><br/>Luca and Ioana arrange an incredible act of arson - setting four houses on fire! - in order to create a diversion for Mekha's rescue from the Keep. It looks like the fire may spread to the rest of the town, while all the PCs are busy dealing with other things. (Sergio is rescuing Mekha, while Luca and Giancarlo are dealing with the newly-arrived Vargas.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460164/#Comment_460164" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-13T00:03:04+00:00" title="February 13, 2017 12:03AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm bringing in various elements from the characters' history by framing flashbacks and then reincorporating people from the past into the current narrative. I'm using lots of the excellent ideas brought forth here in this thread:<br/><br/>The war is heating up on the other side of the kingdom, and many people are being displaced. This includes Giancarlo's family: his eldest son, whom he left in charge, to take care of his large family, is in fact now a mercenary working for the Vargas (as a pretext to travel and to find his father).<br/><br/>Lance Captain Kalkmann turns out to be a mercenary, now in the hire of the Vargas, and their chief enforcer. He and Sergio have some history between them, and both have a reason to hate the other. Sergio's player has made it very clear that he will happily put his character's life on the line to kill Kalkmann, if it comes to that.<br/><br/>Luca's bakery is in disarray and he owes a major debt to his Tchegaran suppliers of flour. Giancarlo steps in and "takes over" the debt, informing Luca that the baker is now to pay him (Giancarlo), while he sends installments of money to the Tchegarans.<br/><br/>Sergio and Luca are easy enough to hook, having strong drives and passions, and they have now lots to accomplish and many balls in the air.<br/><br/>Giancarlo was the tricky one, if you'll recall - a character with no clear goals or morals. It turns out that this was pretty intentional: the player explained to me that he thinks people "always play the same character" in RPGs, and so he came to the game with a very specific goal before the game even began. He wanted his character's determining feature to be a strong enmity towards another player's character (Luca, in this case).<br/><br/>The whole session, I started putting more power and more decisions into his hands, both good (information, deferrals) and less good ("Boss, what do we do with this stolen treasure?"). He enjoyed coming up with clever and self-serving ways to take charge of the situation and arrange deals which benefit himself, while skirting the edge of the law. (For instance, with the stolen Varga treasure, he told his men to separate it into two piles - the valuables stamped with the Varga crest, and the rest. The valuables that are clearly stamped or marked he will be returning to the Vargas, as though they were stolen and he fought hard to get them back. The other pile, of course, will go into his own pockets. This way his men are happy - he is not punishing them - the Vargas should be impressed with his "hard work" - and he gets a good chunk of change for himself.)<br/><br/>Indeed, this seems to be the player's fun in this game: to see how much this character can get away with while still appearing like a lawful figure working for the good "of the people". <br/><br/>However, I have thrown two wrenches into his plans, and we will see how he deals with them:<br/><br/>* The Vargas have brought some of their own armed men with them to the town, and plan to force him and the Guardsmen to stand down while they take over entirely.<br/><br/>* His favourite son is among them.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure if the player would find this distracting or inspiring. Throughout the session I threw bits about his family into the mix (he received a letter from home, spotted his son in the crowd, and so forth), but he tended to ignore those, leaving them "for later" (for instance, he still has not read the letter). However, he seems quite excited by his son's presence. <br/><br/>Questions for you, dear readers:<br/><br/>1. What do you think of Giancarlo's situation now? How would you engage with him? Any other observations on how this has developed so far?<br/><br/>2. How would you deal with the conflagration which threatens to spread through the town? After all, it's a dangerous and wild fire, and it's only the NPCs who are tending to it. How can I resolve the situation in a fair but interesting way, if the PCs are effectively pretty busy doing other things? (Although pulling them back in some way isn't out of the question! I just don't want to twist their arms to get involved, so the ideal solution would work well no matter how they choose.)<br/><br/>3. In general, the session finished in a very hectic, panicked, high-tension moment. The town is on fire, Sergio is on the run, and all the storylines are coming to a head. There are a lot of "moving parts" in terms of the town's factions all being active, and I often find that kind of thing (larger-scale actions by different groups of people) hard to handle. Any advice on this front?<br/><br/>* I'm tempted to try to start the third session in a calmer, slower pace (with the fire burning in the background), by zooming in on some small-scale actions and character interactions. (e.g. Giancarlo having a heart-to-heart with his son) Do you have any tips or tricks for developing a session in this direction, while maintaining the sense of crisis and tension?<br/><br/>* How would you handle the actions of all the other movers and shakers in this scenario? There is a lot happening, and, aside from Giancarlo, the PCs are happy to be doing some things in the background, chasing after their own interests. This suggests to me that I might "plan out" the potential events of the next day or so ("what happens if the PCs do not interfere"), and see how much of that survives contact with the PCs' actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460184/#Comment_460184" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-13T14:53:00+00:00" title="February 13, 2017  2:53PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd guess I'd let the PCs run the show for now.

I struggled with the somewhat passive approach the players were taking throughout, but I kept escalating the situation through the actions of the NPCs, and trying to hand off as much power and responsibility (along with big problems) to the PCs.<br/><br/>This didn't always work out 100%; often, the players sought safe options and made decisions to put off developments as much as possible.<br/><br/>For example, Luca and Giancarlo had a real, serious enmity, and Giancarlo had ruined Luca's bakery by letting out all his casks and spoiling his flour. This left Luca destitute, but unable to complain, since his brewing was technically against the law.<br/><br/>During the fire, it was threatening to spread to the city, and I told Giancarlo that he only had enough helpers to save one building - either the bakery or the Varga estate.<br/><br/>That's when Luca showed up and told Giancarlo nicely that his bakery didn't matter, and that what was important was protecting the estate. So, of course, they agreed to let the bakery burn. It was an interesting development in some respect, but also a letdown as far as dramatic escalation is concerned.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the rules contributed nicely to developing play, and I'm very happy with the dynamics that took place. When we engaged with the mechanics (especially in the finale) some pretty wild stuff went down.<br/><br/>The game ended in a dramatic and bloody Tarantino-esque finale, with a messy conflict blossoming into near-carnage, one character losing their life, and two others losing their minds. They likely all ended up in jail or worse. And yet it was incredibly satisfying.<br/><br/>We were all a bit shocked at the ending, and simultaneously happy to "fade to black" on the aftermath. If it had been a film, it would have been a powerful one despite the lack of "resolution" (or, perhaps, because of it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460900/#Comment_460900" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T07:26:55+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  7:26AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460908/#Comment_460908" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T00:33:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2017 12:33AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed!

It was a lot of fun, and everyone enjoyed it. The rules worked well and were a success, the story was exciting. It just wasn't *quite* as easy to run as I had hoped.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out why it felt that way, and unsure what I could have done differently.<br/><br/>Even the end - as dramatic as it was - the PCs undertook very meaningful actions, but, ultimately, these actions were at the service of the NPCs. (For example, Luca sacrificed his life - or at least his freedom; we faded to black as he was being overcome by guards - to allow Ina and Ioana a chance to escape and to build a new life somewhere else. It was a good ending for Luca, but, in the end, it felt like we were watching Ina and Ioana's story, sometimes more so than Luca's.)<br/><br/>It's odd because I've run this same scenario before, and it felt quite different.<br/><br/>I'll be playing Monsterhearts with these same players next; I'm very curious to see how they will approach it differently (and I hope they do).<br/><br/>Any other advice would be very welcome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460956/#Comment_460956" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T06:36:13+00:00" title="March  7, 2017  6:36AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I donno man.

This is very different from other kinds of passivity I've encountered. It kind of goes back and forth, and they engage very fully with some material but not with other material. It doesn't feel predictable, either.<br/><br/>For instance, Giancarlo, who has a strong enmity against Luca, was alone in Luca's bakery in the first session. He immediately went ahead and basically ruined the place! Yikes!<br/><br/>However, after that I threw other opportunities into his lap (at the end of the second session, he was provided with very strong evidence that Luca had set the town on fire!), and he kinda went, "Hmmm, interesting!", and put it in his back pocket, never bringing it up again.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure this out.<br/><br/>It's also a bit odd, because you just posted your "I only GM for GMs" concept, which is pretty interesting. However, in this group, the newbies are doing great... it's the one guy who is a GM that I can't quite connect to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461000/#Comment_461000" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T13:45:35+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  1:45PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some thoughts on why a player may appear overly cautious. I don't know which ones apply to your situation, but perhaps I mention something that you haven't considered.<br/><br/>* Some people prefer to be in audience mode and watch the other players and GM play. Even though we all in some way look up to people who take center stage, not everyone wants to be that person. They may be uncomfortable having all eyes on them that judge their moves, and may gain a greater satisfaction from observing others who prefer being the center of attention. You can gently put these players center stage and encourage their contributions however small, but they might never turn into someone who takes the initiative themselves.<br/><br/>* There's existential pain involved in making choices, and some people don't like that. Some RPGs thrive on putting impossible decision in the player's lap to see what they do, but for some people the pain of making the "wrong" decision (and they may all be wrong from different points of view) is greater than the satisfaction they get from making that choice. Having to decide whether you save your wife or your daughter from the burning building might make a great scene in a film or novel, but may obviously be painful to act out. Other decisions may require your PC to turn into a bad guy, someone who lies, steals or murders, and you may not like to play that character. You have your pure motivations and morals, but suddenly you have to compromise them to get things done in game, which means you rather not do anything at all if the choice is between murder and doing nothing. You can help players like these by picking a game that doesn't require hard choices, or by tuning down the angst and shift focus from "if you pick A you don't get B!" to "do you want to get A or B first?"<br/><br/>* After playing RPGs for some time, you may have learned that anything you show affection for in game is threatened or taken away by the GM. If you decide to have a daughter in game, she's kidnapped. If you decide to have a horse and wagon in a fantasy game, the horse is shot and killed by an arrow in an ambush and the wagon is burned. Any time you show the GM that something is important to your PC, or to yourself as a player, the GM sees that as something to go after. But if you play coolly, your relationships and stuff are safe. It's like in war movies when they tell the protagonist to not get attached to anyone else, because they might get killed tomorrow and then the pain is greater. This is especially a problem for veteran roleplayers, who have seen this happen before. You can help these players by declaring some fictional stuff off limits, or by giving the player veto power over things they control.<br/><br/>* The player may be in damage-control mode, seeing GM prompts only as problems to solve and dispose of as quickly as possible and not as a starting point for their own contributions. As GM, you can't force the players to go after something themselves and if they try to play someone who wants to avoid "adventure", they can deflect direct "attacks" and ignore carrots waved in front of them indefinitely. If the fictional situation deteriorates (their daughter is kidnapped or their wagon is destroyed) it's not *their* fault, it's the GM's. Maintaining status quo is a very reasonable approach in real life, but in an RPG the PCs risk becoming non-viable protagonists when order is restored. If their daughter is kidnapped and order is restored by getting her back, this will end the RPG story (or film), which means we have to stop it from happening too soon. If we're making a film, we can pace the story to last 90 minutes, but in an RPG we want a great plan that is successfully implemented to be successful without an artificial time limit. This situation can't be resolved with in-game solutions, as the problem is on a player-and-GM-expectations level. Only by discussing the game and how you want it to play can you (perhaps) move away from just maintaining status quo.<br/><br/>* This is linked to damage-control mode, but sometimes players may see their responsibility not as searching for conflict and escalating, but as avoiding conflict. Same as maintaining status quo, this is useful when you're part of a group or in the workplace, but doesn't make for very interesting stories. "Ruth always ate my sandwich from the office fridge, so the next day I poisoned my sandwich to get back at her" would be horrible in real life, but interesting in a film. If some or all players always pick the reasonable choice, avoiding intra- and inter-group conflicts, then not a lot will happen. If their daughter is kidnapped, the real-life reasonable choice would be to call the police and just wait, which may not be very interesting. In a story, we want them to chase the kidnappers or otherwise engage with the conflict. If the players see a potential conflict and go for it, the GM's job is a lot easier than if they're trying to avoid conflict. The GM will then spend a lot of time trying to engineer conflict, which the players can dodge by saying "My PC doesn't really care about that thing you threaten" or "My PC complains about their lot in life, but won't do anything about it". Again, a real-life talk about what the actual content of a session should be and how the players and GM can help each other get there is needed to improve the game.<br/><br/>Perhaps something of the above is relevant to your situation, and can help you identify how to move forward? Do you recognize anything of what I said from the game, or did I miss the point?<br/><br/>I could guess and pick events that you have described and try to assign a motive, but you know the situation best and it's always easiest to ask the players "Why did you pick A instead of B?" Listen to the in-character motives if the players give them "My PC would never do B!" or "My PC didn't pick B because of this potential consequence", or out-of-character if given "B sounded boring!". The "would never do B" response is obviously interesting, because then you can challenge that belief in game, but that risks disengaging the player if the answer was really "B sounded boring" or "B sounded really disturbing". Always try to get an out-of-character response as well.<br/><br/>I've had a hard time with this, because many players will *only* cite in-character motives and will claim they themselves had no choice but to stay true to the fictional character they just created. I see choices as decisions on what future events to include and as a way of defining the character, not only presenting a finished character, but I think I'm more of an author than an actor. When a player says "I could only pick A, B was out of the question", I could see it as a failure as GM when I set up the situation (and I usually do). I've learned that some players (and people in general) just see fictional situations in this black-and-white way and it's not much I can do to change it. The best I can do is try to identify and amplify conflicts and dilemmas, but whether they make for a hard choice is out of my hands and with the players, depending on how much they engage with the content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461004/#Comment_461004" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T14:31:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  2:31PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2017 2:51PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to add that I have a preference for audience mode as well, both as a player and GM, so audience-author rather than actor. In impro theater, a basic tenant is to make the other actor look good which really suits me. I like to input stuff, then lean back and observe my co-players be awesome. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is what the experience roleplayer and game master is trying to do? Perhaps they don't want to steal the spotlight from the newcomers, and instead tries to avoid becoming the center of attention? Since they have their own sense of pacing, you may become baffled when they engage some conflicts and not others without any reasons observable to you?<br/><br/>I realized that you can also look at this from a group dynamics perspective. In a group you have leaders and followers, but also mediators that resolve conflicts rather than stoke the flames and other roles. Look at this link: <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/resed/resed/staffresources/RM/training/grouproles.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.stanford.edu/group/resed/resed/staffresources/RM/training/grouproles.html</a><br/><br/>These roles apply both to the players and the PCs. One of the hindering roles are Withdrawing, which may happen at a gaming table, and with suggestions how to handle it. But a lot of the functional roles such as Encouraging, Harmonizing, or Compromizing may at the table look as if the player is not engaging with the conflict, when in reality they are trying to resolve it.

I guess it just means those people aren't playing the right games, right?<br/><br/>I once played with a very well-known OSR/old-school gamer (and game author), who wanted to play a "story game". We played The Shadow of Yesterday, and it was a sweet adventure, with a young boy in love with a girl above his station, a scary killer from their past, and a duel of honour.<br/><br/>Afterwards, he said that he enjoyed it, but felt like there was too much on the line. Seeing his young protege fall in love with the "wrong girl" was intense and scary for him, whereas, in his words, "in a D&amp;D game, the worst thing that can happen is that my character can be dismembered by unearthly monsters".<br/><br/>I thought that was really interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461023/#Comment_461023" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T21:51:59+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  9:51PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great comments, Jonas.<br/><br/>I've seen many of those behaviours in players before, but this particular group has me stumped.
