So I thought I would point out that Moon Designs has a kickstarter for their new Guide To Glorantha. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/224590870/the-guide-to-glorantha" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/224590870/the-guide-to-glorantha</a><br/><br/>In full disclosure, I have been involved with this project as a reviewer. It's ready to go, it just needs help covering the costs of the print runs. It is not Hero Wars focused, instead its intended to be the encylopedia of Glorantha for anyone interested in that game world. It builds on some of the classic world guide products such as Genertela: Crucible of the Hero Wars, but includes Palmetela and the Islands, has been extensively reworked from Greg's archives and enhanced and updated for current understanding and playability. Jeff went to a lot of effort to define the 'look and feel' for the art so that it was consistent, made sense, and kept to a late bronze age and early iron age feel. <br/><br/><a href="http://moondesignpublications.com/page/look-glorantha" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://moondesignpublications.com/page/look-glorantha</a><br/><br/>The resulting art is the finest vision there has been of Glorantha<br/><br/>A lot of work has been done on rationalizing outlier elements like the West, and that holistic approach has pulled together the patchwork of Glorantha into a whole.<br/><br/>I've backed it, I hope some of you want to too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398051/#Comment_398051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T05:31:46+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  5:31AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've been looking at this, definitely seems worth the expense. Glorantha is one of my handful of gaming weaknesses, and a systemless setting work is exactly what I've been desiring for it. I don't usually want to have real books on my bookshelf, but I'll make an exception for Glorantha books.<br/><br/>The reward levels on that Kickstarter page are pretty confusing, though, what with the various maps that might or might not be part of given reward levels. Like, should I get the "High Priest" at $150 if I want everything in hardcover, or are the mystery maps at "Rune Lord" worth the extra $50? Or is MoLaD at $500 actually worth the extra $300 for the maps? Takes some doing to separate the products from the prestige money-sinks; probably would be much easier to just wait for this stuff to come out for ordinary purchase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398059/#Comment_398059" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T06:50:56+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  6:50AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts are the same, I can't justify that kind of cash.

We're also updating the FAQ today to better describe some of the offerings, such as the 11x17 poster map set, the Greg "Archival" map set, and the "Roots of Glorantha" series. I believe you will now see a smoother transition of what you get for higher pledge levels, and hopefully find them easier to understand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398222/#Comment_398222" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T14:00:00+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  2:00PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just in case folks have not been tracking - the project has reached its funding goal within 24 hours and is rapidly advancing through the stretch goals for more art and maps.

Basically what you want as a Glorantha fan is the $150 "high priest" package that includes both books in hardcover. One could make an argument for the "Dwarf" pdf-only package at $50, but at least for me it seems that if I'm going to pay that much (or rather, engage in Internet shoppery at all - I buy stuff very rarely), I might as well pay some more to have paper books. And if I'm getting books on paper, I might as well get ones that look good and are durable. The other levels and knick-knacks on offer here, on the other hand, are luxury items with relatively little practical significance; I did consider the paper maps at length for +$100, but decided that they're unlikely to be as useful as an atlas in book form.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think that I'm going to make an exception here and participate in this Kickstarter. Now I'll just need to wait for the offerings to stop shifting around just in case something comes about and changes my evaluation.<br/><br/>(And yes, I am old-fashioned enough to think that there must be easier ways to shop than Kickstarter. People seem to like the game show elements, though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398407/#Comment_398407" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T01:51:49+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  1:51AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can change or cancel a Kickstarter pledge anytime before it ends.
