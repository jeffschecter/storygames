She's a manager, and even on her days off, which she'll refer to as a "day off", she'll still go in and pull a couple of hours. So, this is one of those situations where there's nothing to be done; it's just annoying. It doesn't help that she has wicked ADD and can't concentrate for more than two hours per session, but at least the upshot is that she insists on playing as often as possible, which works for everyone.<br/><br/>I've been able to say "no texting, no phone calls" with previous groups (I mean, if it's an emergency, okay, fine ^_^), but this time I can't, in fairness, make it stick. One thing that has been an ironclad rule for a long time is: spectators should be seen and not heard. For some reason, I tend to meet people who are intrigued by RPGs, but don't actually want to play (or at least, don't want to use rules in any meaningful way). I had a player's girlfriend once ask/insist that there was a flautist in the scene, in-game, and could she portray him, okay, go - and then she starting pretending to play the flute. Thus, when the president of my cooperative asked if he could sit in on a session, I said sure, <i>provided he not speak</i>. He asked a couple of questions early on, and I told him, "You're cool, man, it's just distracting", and that seemed to work out okay. <br/><br/>I'm going to check out that "Playing in Public" thread - none of us have big enough rooms at the co-op (at least, ones with enough space) that we can play in privacy, so we end up going to the kitchen or the common room instead, which of course means several walk-through interruptions every session (yeah, even in the span of two hours). While the exchange students (who are legion) tend to stop for a moment to ask questions, the Americans living here seem to know that we're "doing something" and act like we've hung up a Do Not Disturb sign at every entrance. We don't tell anyone to piss off, as it's not just our space, but it's far from ideal being there in the first place.<br/><br/>Le sigh. /rant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211454/#Comment_211454" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T15:11:55+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  3:11PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any variant of "Whatever you say is considered to be in character unless you make X signal or preface it with Y statement" has pretty much been the death knell of every group I've been in where it existed.<br/><br/>It wouldn't work for my current groups because a large part of our play is communicating expectations as we go through OOC chatter. We don't have the benefit of being harmonious enough individuals to achieve mutual understanding somehow through deep character immersion.

Like "No cellphones" could be this kind of rule with one group, and not with another. "Whatever you say is considered to be in character unless you make x signal or whatever" often has been, IME, but I've had groups where it wasn't. And possibly because it wasn't, it didn't kill the game.

Games have rules, but do we really need social rules as well? When I play with the local teenagers, for example, they defer to my age and experience. When we play with my expert roleplayer friends, we communicate like adults. Setting up rules smacks too much like clumsy pre-teen club activities to me. Children might find that rules help them act better, but adults? I'm not seeing it.<br/><br/>To demonstrate - if a teenager in "my game" constantly plays with his phone, I tell him to put it away and concentrate. I can do this, not because we have some sort of funky tablet nailed to the wall with a "no cellphones, we're roleplaying dammit" rule on it, but simply because I'm the adult in the room and I'm expected to keep the activity focused. Some calls are important, some are not; some people wouldn't fiddle with the phone if they didn't need to, some would; some games are distracted by the phone, some are not. I have no reason whatsoever to make "no phones while playing" a rule when reason alone guides us in what's appropriate and what's not. The same goes for most of the social rules people have discussed here.<br/><br/>Might just be that we play in a too relaxed manner. Perhaps a really fast and intense gaming style would benefit from rules. To me making rules for when somebody is speaking in-character sounds like the group has been clenching their buttocks too hard, but surely it must be an useful rule for somebody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211498/#Comment_211498" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T17:55:23+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  5:55PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2009 5:56PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I can do this, not because we have some sort of funky tablet nailed to the wall with a "no cellphones, we're roleplaying dammit" rule on it,</blockquote>\nI know you don't mean that literally, but the thought of it still made me laugh.  Just imagining a group where they DID write down and post their social rules publicly makes me laugh, though I'm sure I'd stop laughing real fast if I ever found myself playing in such a group.<br/><br/>I think, by and large, what people were referring to as rules in the other thread and here are more along the lines of "this is the kind of behavior we as a group do or do not encourage."  They say "no cellphones," meaning that they personally turn off their own phones when they play and say -- or at least WANT to say -- "Could you please put that away and concentrate?" when the kid next to them is more engrossed in his texting than in the activity around the table.  And possibly that in their group, they've all agreed among themselves that they don't like having cellphones ringing during the game, and so they all choose to turn them off at the beginning.<br/><br/>For my part anyway, they are social rules in the way that people not tramping through the flowerbed to knock on the front door is a social rule: there's no security guard standing there to enforce a big "KEEP OFF THE GRASS" sign and put an armlock on anyone who steps off the concrete, you just don't invite over people who'd treat your prized gladiolas like a mosh pit.<br/><br/><br/>(Oh, and the signal-to-talk-out-of-character thing that Leonard brought up?  I was so glad no one posted that one in the other thread.  I've been in groups that did that, and it was always horrible.  Only terrible, terrible people do that, seriously.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211502/#Comment_211502" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T18:10:33+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  6:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah its not like we have the third stone tablet of moses here, just that there are expectations and that they are enforced to some extent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor" title="peteramthor"><img alt="peteramthor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://trulyrural.com/cyberavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor">peteramthor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211504/#Comment_211504" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T18:22:00+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  6:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah the no upper limit on the group size is a no winner here as well.

We are a talky bunch and all of us can get sidetracked from time to time, but any such rule seems to squelch the fun as we watch what we say very much.  This even seemed to be the case when our D&amp;D foray added a "be ready on your init" rule that caused us to be too aware of the combat mechanics and less aware of the fun of the game.

Eero, social groups have rules that guide their behavior regardless of whether they want them or not. It doesn't have anything to do with posting them on the wall, or even explicitly acknowledging their existence.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a>, for me the no cell phone rule doesn't work because I'm a husband and father and have to be reachable.
