Perhaps, indeed, themes like this are at the heart of all roleplaying games. You roll the dice and your fate depends on fortune alone.</b><br/>-----<br/><br/>I relayed a memorable moment in my gaming that was 100% a "dice moment" (copied below). What's your memorable moment involving dice?<br/><br/>----- <br/>(answer to the above, and the dice vignette)<br/><br/>Hell yes. Who hasn't cheered over a critical hit on a d20, or a botched roll that we had a lot (in our minds) riding on? That feeling of luck, fate and exhilaration is one of the reasons I think that even the hippie small-press folks are so in love with using a randomization mechanic, with dice at the square center of that randomization: That rush, triumph and defeat is really exciting as a player.<br/><br/>Here's a story: As a side-adventure to our Long AD&amp;D 2E Campaign in high school, the DM did a 3-session adventure set in another area of his campaign, a Mythic Scotland kind of realm. I remember very little, that I was a fighter with a two-handed sword, and that I ran naked in the snow to an altar where I killed some witches or something.<br/><br/>But I do remember one thing VERY clearly about that campaign, and it's the most vivid memory of those entire 3 sessions:<br/><br/>When I rolled my fighter character, I had an 18 strength (we used a die assignment method from one of the AD&amp;D supplements which pretty much assured you of one "18" if you wanted it) and I had to roll percentile dice to determine what my "percentile strength" was.<br/><br/>I rolled a 97. I rolled it, my best friend was watching. I hollared and started writing down this great score on my sheet.<br/><br/>But the DM didn't see it. He didn't watch me roll it. He called BS, saying "Look, I trust you and all, but for this and hit points I need to *see* the roll. That's the way we play." And to my credit (I was 16 at the time) I thoughtfully nodded my head, agreeing "thems are the rules". 'Sides, it was only a mini-campaign, so I didn't really care too strongly. So I rolled again, in front of the DM.<br/><br/>I rolled a 00. One hundred. The single highest score, which has its own special damage and attack bonus categories. We all cheered, even the DM. <br/><br/>Again, I remember little about that campaign, but man I still remember making that die roll.<br/>-----<br/><br/>So again, what's your memorable moment involving dice? Good, Bad, Weird?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255632/#Comment_255632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T20:44:51+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  8:44PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I gotta say on the side: I thought this topic came up before, so I did an Advanced search for "Dice" in the topic. <br/><br/>There are lots of threads about dice here.<br/><br/>Furthermore, many, many, many of them are quite interesting.

I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. It was 30 years ago and I still remember it vividly.<br/><br/>I was running Space Opera, in which you roll stats on d100 (and then check a table to get scores of 1-19). <br/>I'd hacked the game to split the Psionics stat into two - a strength and a skill.<br/>My younger brother, who I always made sport of at that age, rolled his psionics and got a 100 on both rolls in full view of me and the other two players.<br/>I HAD seen the rolls, but I pretended I hadn't - "oh dear, I never saw it. You'll have to reroll - that's the way we do things." He'd already got well above the other players on the rest of the stats, he didn't need to be awesome here too.<br/>He complained, the other two players laughed but didn't say anything.<br/>So he rolled again, and got 100 twice, again.<br/><br/>We were all bowled over, awed in that, "that's not osmething you see every day" kind of way. He was jubilant, and I grudgingly accepted it: "You can't fight fate!"<br/><br/>I'd have checked the dice to see if they were loaded, but they were my dice. Although I never got them back after that. They were his lucky dice now3 - and were used a year or so later for one memorable strike against a dragon in a rolemaster game.<br/><br/>In RM, you roll percentile for your attacks, and if you roll 96-00 yoll roll again and add. Then add your attack bonus and subtract defence, check a table for damage.<br/>If you get high enough damage, you score a critical, and again roll percentile for that. In that old edition, if you were facing Large or Super Large creatures, you rolled again if you got 96+.<br/><br/>So, the group had just roused the oldest deadliest dragon, and were fleeing as it flew towards them. My brother thought he had time for one shot before they reached the safety of the caves, and took the chance. He then learned he'd miscalculated - his pause meant he was going to be in the dragons firebreath when it acted. His attack roll got a roll up, and with that and the dragons defence, he still got only just enough for a critical roll. That roll was at a penalty, but he rolled up three times, and got the maximum possible result. So, one arrow later, the dragon plummeted from the sky, drawing comparisons with Smaug's death.<br/><br/>You play an rpg long enough, you see all sorts of crazy, unlikely dice rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255656/#Comment_255656" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T00:26:12+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 12:26AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got two:<br/><b>The Botch!</b><br/>Played an awesome fighter who fought with a double sided spiked chain of...awesome! We got to that epic "boss battle" and I whipped my chain out had initiative picked my four d20 up for my attacks threw the dice down and everyones jaws dropped. I looked down and...all 1's. So the gm decided bah your weapon flys up into the tree above the enemy. We figured meh I climb the tree one round (I had a high climb) then like jump on the guy after. Yea for the rest of the combat I did not roll over a 5 to climb. <br/>It was so funny.<br/><br/><b>The crit!</b><br/>Playing a master of many forms we came up against again our big bad guy of the first of series of story arches. We meet in the chambers of the wizards and while everyone starts battling minions I turn into a bat and fly above the wizard unnoticed the gm not sure what my intentions are. Once I got to the highest point of the chamber (the max falling distance for damage) and then turned into an elephant above him! The gm decided on a ranged attack roll which I rolled and confirmed a 20 on, followed by a near max damage roll for falling. After all the damage was dealt I killed the wizard in the first attack! The end result however was activating a trigger spell which randomly teleported me randomly in front of a minion, which proceeded to crit me and then kill me. &lt;-- awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255663/#Comment_255663" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T02:46:59+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  2:46AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote this a-ways back, but it fits the bill:\n<blockquote><b>\u201cGood shot MacReady!\u201d</b><br/><br/>So about a million years ago I'm running a Star Frontiers game. It's D&amp;D in space, about an inch away from listening at doors. The PCs uncover a spy in the computer center, but before they can grab him he dashes into the maze of computer terminals, needler in hand. Two characters catch up with him and pile on, but they can't take him out. This is not their fault, since in Star Frontiers it takes about 18-25 unarmed hits to drop a normal person. Knocking someone out is even harder \u2014 roll a 01-02 on percentile. 2% chance. If you are using a blunt weapon and you get a roll ending in 0 that also hits, that also counts. So if you need a 45 or less to hit, you have a 6% chance of a knock-out instead of 2%. Woo hoo.<br/><br/>A few embarrassing rounds go by before John's character strolls up to the pig pile. John is the epitome of cool. He looks down on his fellow PCs rolling around on the floor.<br/><br/>"I got him," John says casually, and then announces he will cold-cock the spy with his rifle butt.<br/><br/>02.

There's a rule that, when you're untrained in a skill, there's a 1% chance of success. Usually, the rule seems pretty pointless, and you roll without any hope of succeeding.<br/><br/>But, at our game, someone actually rolled 01. It was very exciting. We sat and stared at it. Surely that must be 10, not 01? But no. He'd rolled a 1% chance when he needed it.<br/><br/>Simon has a theory that dice are fun, regardless of what you're rolling for. Do you remember that silly thread, a while ago, when I encouraged people to roll a d20 and post how they felt? That stemmed from Simon's idea. The night before, he had made me roll a d20, to see how I felt about it. I got a 16.

She promptly fumbled (00) and we made good our escape.<br/><br/>We're playing MERP. The PCs have found a secret way into the castle but it's down a creepy smelly tunnel. It's also pitch black. Suddenly something huge rears up in front of them, from the smell, it's a Troll! The elf says, I jump over him and stab him in the back. There is an 8" clearance between the troll and the ceiling, the player rolls a score in the 300s by rolling 95+ three times and stacking. The troll is stunned by the elegance of the manoeuvre. But still, it's a troll and will take quite some killing. The same player rolls an attack and again gets a ginornmous score, rolling 95+ three times and stacking. Then he rolls 66 on the crit. The troll is toast. The character feels he is invincible and gets killed by a hobbit with a sling 10 minutes later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255692/#Comment_255692" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T06:07:27+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  6:07AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My most memorable was a game of Warhammer (the war game, not the RPG) about two years ago.

He rolled one, and as it bounced across the table, it came to a slow rolling stop. The die stopped on its corner, and stayed there. We both blinked, not believing what we saw.

Hector takes an unbelievable amount of fallout during the conflict - at least 8d10 and a whole pile of d8 and d6 fallout, enough that Kit can barely roll all the dice. I manage to avoid taking serious fallout - just d6s. Lazarus wasn't too bad off, just 2d10 and a few d8s. But in the end, we win the conflict and Hector is stopped. Time to roll fallout.<br/><br/>"I can take it I'm not getting medical attention?" Kit quips as he picks up his dice. "Fuck you," was the general response. So I roll my fallout and turn out to be okay. "Okay, dude," I say to Nick. "Just don't roll a 20 and I can heal you."<br/><br/>Nick rolls a 20. Everyone's faces fall. Then we look at Kit, who rolls his massive poo pile of dice. AND HIS HIGHEST PAIR IS AN ELEVEN. So we decided that the demons were actually twisting Hector's many, many wounds shut even as Lazarus bled out from his one gunshot. I remember being horrified that the dice would kill Lazarus, who was the best of all of our characters, and still let Hector live. Hands down, it was the most surprising die roll I've ever experienced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255718/#Comment_255718" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T08:34:52+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  8:34AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 8:38AM by Wordman.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More than 25 years ago, and I'm teaching a friend AD&amp;D.; While rolling up my character, I'm going out of my way to make a point about how rolling 4d6 (keeping three) for attributes tends to generate mostly average scores, with a few high, a few low and how this "ensures balance".

One of the characters was a bodyguard, so he has the ability to interpose himself when someone is attacked. He's guarding a government agent and has unknowingly invited an assassin into the group (a blind woman who's a ninja, of course).<br><br>The agent has figured out who she is and why she's there and confronts her, telling her to do her job now or get lost. Naturally she's ends up taking a stab at him. The bodyguard steps in, both go with all out attacks; this means the loser will take double damage and, most likely, die.<br/><br/>We find ourselves just staring at each other when both rolls come up equal, <i>it's a tie</i>. <br/><br/>My brain grinded to a halt, I had no clue what to do. I was (and am) pretty sure the rules say that both takes damage in this case which means they'll probably both go down, which of course is pretty Japanese. But then the player, almost timidly, asks if this might be a matter of pride to his character. He's playing a lion (no, actually a tiger, but we used the lion stats) so he's got an ability called Pride: if it's a matter of pride to him, he gets +3.<br/><br/>Of course it's a matter of pride; he friggin' invited the assassin to the group! He also kinda fell in love with her. And now, he kills her. Suddenly it's not just pretty Japanese, it's about as Japanese as it gets.<br/><br/>Sure, the system played a pretty big role in this whole thing, but damnit, if we hadn't tied or rolls and hadn't been dumbstruck by it, that scene wouldn't have been nearly as beautiful and gut-wrenching.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255749/#Comment_255749" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T10:15:45+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 10:15AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My high school gaming group had just spent months playing the Against the Giants, Against the Drow, Queen of the Demonweb Pits uber arc of first ed D&amp;D; modules.  It was the day of the final showdown with Lloth Demon Queen of Spiders.  I describe the resplendent evil of her throne room and the paladin, for reasons unclear to me to this day, says, "I want to try and Psychic Crush Lloth."

The GM was a real grognard - probably among the first in Norway to even play an RPG. His wife was a n00b (oh yes, that's how we thought about things in those days) who had only recently been shown the glory of gaming. So the authority distribution when it came to all things gamelike was pretty much set. Still, she'd often quibble and challenge his authority, and he'd get grumpy about it. <br><br>In this game, we were up against some huge unmentionable horror - I don't remember which one, probably Nyarlathotep (he was in fashion in our group back then). We had no way of killing it - no weapons were good enough.<br><br>So the wife says: "Can I make napalm?" The answer is a blunt no, and a frown. But she insists. "I even have Chemistry!" "Napalm wasn't invented back then. You can't make it!" "Why can't I invent it? Someone invented it!" He sighs, and says - obviously just to show her how silly it is, and move on - "okay, if you roll a 01".<br><br>The dice hit the table... and, of course, it's a 01. <br/><br/>I still remember the look on her face: Excited and happy, rebellious, and vengeful. "I rolled a one! See? I rolled a one!" <br/><br/>I can't remember what happened to the napalm.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255753/#Comment_255753" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T10:23:07+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 10:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 10:24AM by Tristan.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D and I'm the DM.

One was playing the Victory Games James Bond RPG. My 00 agent was being chased by an enemy helicopter, and I only had a pistol. I've got no real chance of hurting the helo, and while it hasn't shot me full of holes yet, it's only a matter of time. I told the GM I was going to floor it, then drive up a ramp or embankment, jump out of the car, and have it fly up and hit the helicopter. The GM basically said, "Roll the dice and impress me." There it was: 00. Automatic success. Exit the helicopter in flames.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side, I had a GMing experience similar to RichDs. My Shadowrun party has finally caught up with the big bad mage who's been bedeviling them all summer. They manage to trap him in a burning cabin with a force wall around it to keep him from escaping. I figure he's not done yet; this villain has a seriously powerful Acid Stream spell that's going to break him out, no problem. I roll for the spell and yeah, it's effective - either it broke the spell, or it weakened it so much a good swift kick would finish it off. Either way, it looks like the bad guy is going to escape the burning cabin and start delivering more pain. But first, I have to roll for spell drain. I knew there was a real risk here- casting a major manipulation spell at force 10 meant I needed either 5s or 6s to resist drain, and I needed at least four of those to avoid taking crippling wound modifiers. On the other hand, I was rolling about 12 dice, so the odds were doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rolled only a single success, which meant the drain actually knocked out the bad guy. Inside a burning building. Instant anticlimax. The only saving grace in the situation was that my players really, really hated that villain, so they didn't actually mind too much, as long as he was dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255834/#Comment_255834" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T17:26:22+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  5:26PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 5:26PM by droog.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Tell me if I want high or low."<br>"No, I'd rather you just rolled."<br>"Why can't you tell me?

He was a Scorpion Duellist, disgusted with the dishonorable ways of his family, left the Scorpion lands to find honor for himself. His father insisted that he would learn that the Scorpion ways were important, as important as any honor in the empire.<br/><br/>We were loving L5R. It was so damned brutal and when you swung that six-foot razor blade that was also your grandfather's six-foot razor blade, you felt it and men fell like wheat. And you could die quickly too. We had never played in a system that brutal and we were really fascinated.<br/><br/>So, it was the siege of Yasugi Castle and this big bastard of a Scorpion general was picking apart the Hare Clan's only castle. Our PC's were in the castle trying to fight for this noble Minor Clan but we knew it was doomed.<br/><br/>The battle rules for L5R were really cool and the seige was just a harrowing experience. We left the first game of the seige physically tired. After the second game we were exhausted. It was evident after the third game that we weren't going to gain any kind of easy win.<br/><br/>We hoped to get some of the peasants out, thirty were stuck inside the walls. The general offered to allow us to aijutsu duel three of his best and for every one we beat, ten peasants would be allowed to leave unharmed. Aijutsu dueling was no joke and it was really easy to die.<br/><br/>My character was paired with the best duelist in the field, who was also his sister. She was holding my father's sword, a blade I hoped to claim if I won.<br/><br/>We were rolling dice in the open.<br/><br/>I lost.<br/><br/>I got killed.<br/><br/>My player was a real mover and a shaker. Dorokhan wasn't the leader of the party in any real sense but the other players definitely looked ot me/him for direction. And his plots in this campaign, half a dozen sessions in were just developing. The other PC's really respected him trying to find an honorable road when all of his skills and abilities were about a dishonorable one.<br/><br/>And he was dead.<br/><br/>Bam.<br/><br/>The GM was mortified, all of the plans he had for Dorokhan were in the toilet. Honestly, the GM took it harder than me. He told me flat out that if he had been rolling behind a screen he would have fudged it because he adored Dorokhan so much.<br/><br/>I loved it.<br/><br/>I wanted to win the damned duel, don't think I didn't and I wanted to see Dorokhan mature and figure out the empire for himself. But this meant that his father, in a very real way, might have been correct. I made the character to answer a question and the answer wasn't what I expected.<br/><br/>I see this as parallel to GM's who guide the game along with the players rather than force their own pre-scripted ending. As a player too, I have to be ready for a heroic epic to be a tragedy. That is okay.<br/><br/>I made up a Crab clan Shugenja to follow up, so that he would have nothing in common with my politically motivated duelist and when we speak of the Siege of Yasugi Castle, we still have a harsh edge to our voice.<br/><br/>And I wouldn't have it any other way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255937/#Comment_255937" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T09:00:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  9:00AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing D&amp;D with a Ranger/Cleric, and my brother is DM'ing.<br/><br/>We have this "boss fight" against an adult white dragon.

It is a ranged touch attack (which are easy to get right), so chances are I won't miss, and do some decent damage. At least I'll hurt it some more before it goes. I roll so freaking low (not a 1, but I think it was a 2 or 3). Miss! The dragon is out of reach.<br/><br/>During the post-play talk, I ask my brother "How many hp it had left?" "Five." Goddammit!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255951/#Comment_255951" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T09:40:49+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  9:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=247890" rel="nofollow">Previously on Great Moments In Dice</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256394/#Comment_256394" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T15:46:49+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  3:46PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a friend with a knack for this sort of thing.  The heroes are lost in the entrance to the Abyss, where we all know Pazuzu guards the entrances to the demon world.  I have him show up. I have him order the characters around.  They are way weaker than him, and I figure I can get some mileage out of having them get bullied into doing stuff.  Except the wizard/cleric says, "I disintegrate Pazuzu."  I say, "Seriously?  He has magic resistance of like 50% or so, plus his saves are through the roof.  It's got like a 2% chance of success.  He's going to ruin you just for trying."  He insisted, so I rolled a 90-something on the magic resistance and a 1 on the save.<br/><br/>This was the same jerk who'd land on the backs of dragons, cast reverse-heal on them, have it <i>work</i>, and then stab them with a dagger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
