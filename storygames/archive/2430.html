                    I'm working like a maniac this week with ungodly hours. I owe Jason Morningstar some long-overdue Grey Ranks feedback. And, here I am posting this beast of a post on about the only free time I've squeezed in this week. So, Jason, I owe you still!<br/><br/>In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2327&amp;page=2#Item_32" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> Judd links to a really interesting <a href="http://www.podcastdirectory.com/podshows/1141193" rel="nofollow">Fear the Boot podcast interview with Ryan Dancey</a>. I listened to most of the podcast, and what I heard was really intriguing stuff. <br/><br/>First off, let me say quickly that I've met Ryan Dancey in about 2001 or 2002, though he doesn't recall that at all, I'm certain. He's definitely not a jerk. I am not one bit upset or angry with his suggestions. I agree with most, if not everything he had to say. <br/><br/><b>What Dancey said</b><br/><br/>Here are a few of the things he had to say that resulted in some thoughts from me, and a good phone conversation with Paul Czege: <br/><br/>1) The vast majority of people who enjoy RPGs are finding <i>enough</i> of what they want in things like World of Warcraft that the result is probably disastrous for tabletop RPGs over time. (Let me clarify to say <i>tabletop RPGs as they are traditionally recognized</i>, i.e. D&amp;D and Vampire, primarily) People will flock to WoW and similar vehicles, and RPGs will suffer for it.<br/><br/>2) Mainstream RPG products are basically marketed in two ways. A) At the player. <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> At the Game Master. Group A usually wins most of the marketing dollars.<br/><br/>3) For the vast majority of gaming groups, players -- not Game Masters -- determine which game the group will play. Usually this means D&amp;D.<br/><br/>4) The largest surges of new RPG hobbyists occur because of two critical factors: Mobility and suburban lifestyle. The surges occur at two critical times: Adolescence (i.e. ages 12-15, who have no access to transportation) and College (ages 18-22, where access to vehicles also lessens). In both cases, the surge is represented in suburban areas. Surges in customers/hobbyists do not occur in rural areas (no access to transportation, no access to RPG product) nor in urban areas (MUCH access to transportation and much access to ALTERNATIVE activities).<br/><br/>(cont'd below)                </div>

<b>What that means to story gamers</b><br/><br/>Given the above, I have several observations that I think are very relevant to the indie scene and story games.<br/><br/>1) There is a remarkable gap between the vast majority of "Gamers" and people who are interested (at least to date) on indie games, story games, and so on. <br/><br/>This gap explains much, from my perspective. The vast majority of gamers either do not realize story games exist, or they actively want nothing to do with them. I do not think this is a 1:1 match with Creative Agenda (aka GNS). I used to think so. I no longer do.<br/><br/>Yes, there is cross-over. I think that fact says more about story/indie gamers than it does traditional gamers. The fact is, it's the small group of story gamers clamoring to say "But I play D&amp;D too!" and very, very little of the large audience of traditional gamers saying "But I play indie games too!" They're out there, there just aren't a lot of 'em by comparison to the rest of the crowd.<br/><br/>2) Marketing product to players more so than game masters <i>may</i> have lead to the "game masters" demanding something they could not find. This is interesting, but may be difficult to verify, or even act on. More on this split in the next item.<br/><br/>3) Huge numbers of RPG products occupied the "game master" groups' shelves, and went unplayed. If you haven't figured it out by now, that "game master" group is probably us here at Story Games. <br/><br/>Again, it's not as though <i>every single person</i> here literally was his or her group's go-to game master, or even necessarily a game master at all. But, I think that's very likely the trend overall. <br/><br/>It leads me to re-label the "game master" group. It represents very well the split I observed in Point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above. I have referred to this in the past as The Great Divide.<br/><br/>On one side, we have "traditional gamers." By and large, they want to celebrate and observe things they enjoy. The want less to <i>create</i> and <i>imagine</i> and more to <i>partake</i> and <i>reinforce</i>. By definition, they're not interested in imagination (Dancey refers to this very specifically.) <br/><br/>On the other side, we have what I'll call the creators. Most started out in traditional RPG circles. Most remain there. Some are frustrated. Some have moved "over here" to story games (the hobby, not necessarily the forum) and indie games.<br/><br/>Unlike their cohorts, these creators <i>are</i> interested in creating and imagination. The don't want to just celebrate and partake in the games. They want to challenge and create them. (An aside: Part of this meant they also wanted to try lots of different games ... and the vast majority of them went frustrated in that effort.)<br/><br/>4) If it's true that particular ages and demographics result in swells of participation in traditional RPGs, doesn't seem reasonable that similar situations lead to swells in indie and story games participation? I don't have ANY verfiable research to compare to Dancey's amazing facts about adolescence and college. But, I'd be willing to put money down on some causes for indie games. My suspect situations for surges in story games and indie games include: <br/><br/>* Late 20s, when friends/gaming groups move into different cities to pursue work. Individuals are "left alone" and turn inward and to the internet for connections. The result is: more individual game design, more online connections. <br/><br/>* In long-term relationships with significant others, diminishing time one can devote to long-term RPG play. It includes either shorter-term play or inclusion of the significant other in play, or both.<br/><br/>* This is less defined, but one of the situations somehow involves a general dissatisfaction with RPGing experiences in the past. The person just gets tired of playing like he or she "used to" and seeks out a change, often leaving a long-standing group to do so. This seems to happen at ages 26-30.<br/><br/>When I look at my indie pals, they all share some of these suspect situations (or did, recently). <br/><br/>(cont'd below)                        </div>

<b>The bummer of the Great Divide</b><br/><br/>The real down side to this split is that we have two tangetially interacting groups. When one side observes the other doing something they don't like, the result is a culture clash that often takes the form of internet pissing matches. Watch Chris Pramas get really angry and dismissive of Ron Edwards. Watch people criticize RPGnet as a sewer. And so on. The Great Divide is indeed a divisive. This is unnecessary. It appears to also be unavoidable.<br/><br/><b>The Good News</b><br/><br/>Look, there are a few ways to approach this. One conceivable way is to feel challenged by Dancey's observations. To take them as evidence that the industry thumbs its nose at story/indie games because there's just not enough critical mass, and that the "traditional gamers" rather than the "creators" are where the money is.<br/><br/>And, with that, one could take a pretty confrontational approach. Getting mad a Ryan or at other industry notables. Getting frustrated that "they" just won't recognize the innovation or the product indie games and story games have to offer.<br/><br/>But, I'm just not interested in that approach. I think it's foolish. I think there's no reason to think that these two groups of people <i>must</i> be connected, particuarly in terms of commerce. <br/><br/>But, I <i>AM</i> frustrated with industry notables, but not because they don't "accept" indie games or whatever. I'm frustrated because they have apparently not recognized that, in fact, there are two industries that are tengentially related because of history, not because of necessity. Too often, I see communication among traditional gamers and industry-types that <i>take for granted</i> that of course story/indie games are a mere spec of a sub-set within the traditional RPG industry. <br/><br/>I think that's wrong. I think it's wrong because the product indie/story game publishers are creating will never appeal to the vast majority of people for whom World of Warcraft is "enough."<br/><br/>And, I take that as good news. I don't want to sell to those people. They'll never actually play my games! I want to sell to the people who will play my games.<br/><br/>(cont'd below)                        </div>

<b>Something to talk about</b><br/><br/>This series of posts is long. But, I want to talk about it. I think we need to talk about it, and not just as publishers but as hobbyists and enthusiasts. As creators. There is so much here, and it's not just business stuff. It's people stuff. <br/><br/>So! Let's talk. <br/><br/>First, let's get some stuff out of the way.<br/><br/>There are, clearly, numerous individual exceptions to these trends. I view myself as one, for example. Your anecdotal upbringing isn't particularly interesting to me in this thread, but on the other hand, it might be indicative of a larger trend worth talking about. Talk about that! Try to avoid talking about stuff that is purely personal anecdotes.<br/><br/>Second, there's probably plenty to refute in what I said. Maybe even in what Dancey says. Do so reasonably, please. No one's attacking anyone. Every time -- every friggin' time -- this kind of stuff gets talked about, a shitstorm breaks out. Let's avoid that. We're trying to recognize the state of affairs, not exercising our dick-waving.                        </div>

                            First: Yes, I (and most of the people I play with these days, when I play) fit your predicted profile almost perfectly.<br/><br/>Second: I think the problem's a lot more profound than you suggest. I think that the economic, structural, and cultural forces that permitted the two groups to coexist and thrive as a single hobby are collapsing. One of the groups can't exist without those structures - it needs a constant influx of new product to feed it, and new recruits to sustain the constant demographic dropout. The other can be self-sustaining without that matrix, because it's fundamentally a DIY culture. This crisis for the "consumer" gamer-culture (I think that's a more accurate label than "traditional", but that's a whole different thread) breeds a LOT of resentment and tribalism, for some perfectly understandable reasons.<br/><br/>And both of these groups stand to lose something important if they go their separate ways. The "consumer" culture loses its creative pioneers and its most skilled GMs - only social bonds or the lure of the Cult of the Good GM will keep them tied to it over the long term. The "creative" culture loses the social networking advantages of moving through the vastly larger "consumer" sphere trawling for players who want something different - it becomes necessary for this much smaller and more diverse community to build its own parallel institutions. I think you can already see the beginning of this split - "consumers" migrating to MMO-land, where content is largely not their responsibility and they can focus on the social and celebratory aspects of play, and "creatives" shifting to new social footprints favoring pick-up play and a LOT of online play.                        </div>

In all groups there are significant numbers who are less interested (or capable) of either actually reinforcing and celebrating or actually creating and imagining (or whatever we use to classify) -- than there are those interested (or capable) of thinking/dreaming about doing either.                        </div>

Yeah, creating is a different activity than celebrating. We knew that a long time ago, that's why all those years of 'the GM is special!' came about, right?                        </div>

                            Wellll ....<br/>
<br/>
I think you're correct as far as you've gone.  The RPG population as it existed (say) five years ago ... and to a large extent as it exists today ... is divided as you describe.  There is very little representation in groups that both (a) don't want to GM or otherwise get intensely into the guts of the game and (b) want something more than WoW presents.<br/>
<br/>
But isn't that, too, an artifact of history?  If you make an RPG that makes it <i>easy</i> to be creative, then you serve the population of people who want to be creative, but aren't willing to work hard at it.  That's a population that won't want to GM, but also won't be satisfied with WoW.  Yes?<br/>
<br/>
That's a population that has been <b>very, very poorly</b> served by RPGs historically.  But it's also a population that is being better and better served (by design) by new games both Indie and otherwise.                        </div>

                            Hey Matt,<br><br>My own personally significant take-away from the Dancey interview was the realization that the frustrations of indie publishers at the traditional hobby games publishers are as mis-applied as the frustrations of traditional hobby games industry notables at indie publishers. We aren't the market disruption that's hurting them, and they and their customers aren't a stony ignorance that thwarts us. The community of gamers has fragmented under the "good enough" distractions of video games and other entertainments. We are designing for the "<i>challenge</i> and <i>create</i>" community that's left incompletely satisfied by these other entertainments. And because, as Dancey says, the <i>partake</i> and <i>reinforce</i> gamers have always been the decider of what games get played, nothing we design warrants the approbation of the traditional hobby games publisher, because nothing we design can bring <i>partake</i> and <i>reinforce</i> gamers back from their other entertainments. So the traditional hobby games publishers are left to their fight for the attention of the shrinking <i>partake</i> and <i>reinforce</i> community. And our adherents can only get a game to happen with non-gamers or others also in the smaller <i>challenge</i> and <i>create</i> community.<br><br>Paul                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Heya,<br><br>I can see already see us developing similar and parrallel support systems.

Sure. I don't find much of this new stuff, either. It did help me collect some thoughts to talk about, though. Besides the specific insights Ryan shared about those life stages in adolescence and college, the consequences of what he talked about, well, he's been talking about that stuff online in different channels for years. And, he's the first to admit he his information is sort of frozen in time in 2001 or so.                        </div>

                            I certainly fit the GM, create/challenge, 26-30 profile.<br/><br/>May I point out that the groups are not necessarily exclusive of one another with regards to membership.  There are plenty of times when my needs are served by playing GuildWars.  Then there are other times when I'm looking for something else that can only come about through creative collaboration among fellow players in a non-visual environment (face-to-face or typed).  Just like we can enjoy different agendas at different times, we can also move between these different groups depending on our moods.<br/><br/>I'd like to throw out there that there are other venues through which people can be brought into the hobby these days as well, such as chat-based environments where people start out roleplaying without ever having played a tabletop game.  There are huge groups of people who play that way, some of which would definitely be served well by a story game that helps them structure their interactions.                        </div>

                            Christian, that's an excellent point. It's really difficult to talk about, precisely for the reason you cite. I mean, let's say we profile Jason Morningstar as a story games exemplar ... and then find out the guy would play Memoir '44 with me until the sun goes out (and, really, that sounds fucking awesome to me!). The similar kinds of examples are probably endless. Last I knew, my man Keith Senkowski played WoW every week, so does John Harper. They are hardly antagonistic to story/indie games. So, we talk about big groups as though they have non-fluid characteristics, and fit like pegs in holes. And, they don't.<br/><br/>Other venues ... YES. And, my wish would be that people do a better job of making that happen, both as publishers tapping a market and as people finding new pals.                        </div>

                            Matt, I tried to listen to that podcast and I just couldn't keep going.  My attention kept wandering because Ryan Dancey kept talking about this thing that was so profoundly not what I'm interested in.  Which more or less reinforces your point.  (Amusingly, I gave up about 2/3rd of the way through and played some <em>World of Warcraft</em>.)<br/><br/>The thing that amuses me is that folks like Ryan Dancey and Chris Pramas and Insert-Industry-Dude-Here are almost all themselves of the challenge-and-create group.  They themselves want to create and to challenge what has gone before (their challenges usually take the form of different gameworld content, not rules systems).  And they want to sell the products of their challenge-and-create process to the people who want to partake-and-reinforce.<br/><br/>The thing that gets me, and the little pinprick that gets me annoyed at these guys on occasion, is the blithe assumption that that's the way it is and the way it should be -- that the masses are supposed to want their creativity, and they are supposed to supply the masses.  The undercurrent is that the artists deserve an audience, and the audience depends on the artists.  The thing of it is, the audience depends on artists, sure -- but not necessarily any specific artists.  And no artist deserves an audience, no matter how "good" or "important" or "whatever" their work is.  Working off of the expectation of an audience is what kills media and genres; it's what nearly killed comics, and it's what is killing "traditional" RPGs today.<br/><br/>The audience is moving to <em>World of Warcraft</em>, not because WoW is better or more important or even better put together -- it's moving to WoW because MMOs are more accessible.  The "Industry Guys" increasingly remind me of vaudevillians bemoaning motion pictures -- even as their colleagues jump the fence to do the same sort of content-creation work in the new medium, they sit there and complain that they're losing their audience.  I mean, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese" rel="nofollow">their cheese has moved</a>.  And instead of the perfectly reasonable response of moving themselves to where the cheese is, they wonder how to move the cheese back to where they are.  It's things like this that highlight exactly how non-professional RPG publishing is.  Publishing is adapt or die, and RPG publishers steadfastly choose the latter out of misplaced loyalty and irrational resistence to change.<br/><br/>As for us, the story-gamers and the indie designers and whatever other label you want to apply to us... seriously, we just happen to be in the place that the cheese got moved to.  Or perhaps more accurately, where some crumbs of cheese tumbled over to.  And I think we're starting to see, with the increasing bloat of indie titles, our sliver-like market shares dwindling.  I would not at all be surprised if indie games reached saturation in the next year or two, because instead of content, we publish tools.  Content has a very short shelf life; tools have a very long shelf life.  Eventually, we're going to get to the point where there are already enough tools available and there will not be much interest in new tools.  I've already got <em>Sorcerer, Primetime Adventures, Capes, Dogs,</em> and <em>Agon</em>.  Why do I need <em>Bliss Stage</em>?  New products need to not only offer innovative new utility, but they need to offer enough utility at a low enough level of accessibility... and let me tell you, the game I already have in my hand is a lot more accessible than the game I don't own.<br/><br/>...hey look, I can throw around doom and gloom just like Ryan Dancey!<br/><br/>Seriously, though, if our market is the folks who are interested in creating and challenging, and doing so on paper with other people around a table, in regularly scheduled blocks of time set aside for that purpose... blogs, YouTube, and MySpace garage bands are our WoW.  Let POD publishing mature for another few years and DIY novel-writing (NaNoWriMo's grandkids) will be another big contender.  So the question is: are you going to get up and follow our cheese when it moves?                        </div>

Awesome! I have my own reservations about the research. I find certain aspects of the results awfully questionable. I'm no statistician. I am a marketer, professionally. Something in my gut says pieces of it ain't right. So, I'd love to hear whether you think things I'm talking about here are way off base as a result of that. I try to be conservative in my observations for that reason. But, I do indeed make speculations. I'm not claiming otherwise.<br/><br/><b>Tony</b>: That post explained it for me. Excellent! I'm aiming at a similar design right now myself (my game 44). I think there are several of us out there working on the one-nighter, likely. It makes good design sense, as far as I'm concerned.                        </div>

                            I don't have much to add except "amen, Matt" and "this is really important."<br/><br/>The life or death or overall health of the mass-market RPG industry doesn't really affect grassroots roleplaying much.  We have the tools to survive without it and, really, we always did.  The internet and POD just made it a lot easier.<br/><br/>One thing I think we'll see more of, though, is that, as the mass-market begins to shrink, it's possible that a few mid-tier mass-market publishers or game lines will get relaunched as what are effectively indie games, as their creators look into self-publishing.  I think the future of <i>Nobilis</i> already seems to be headed in this direction, since both Hogshead and GoO went under and <i>Nobilis</i> was never a great fit for the mass market to begin with.  It's possible that more freelancers will pull a John Wick or Chad Underkoffler and choose to self-publish instead of freelance in a market with diminishing returns.    So there may be a significant future in folks leaping across the Great Divide, so to speak.  And the question for us is whether we're prepared to welcome them.  Certainly we've done a better job with some folks than others.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>The funny thing about that Dancey interview that you didn't listen to is that he said that. Specifically, he said it about TSR. They didn't publish what people wanted, they published what they thought people should want. And it killed them. <br/><br/>Matt, <br/><br/>I've had reservations about the MR that Dancey points to as well. In addition to everything Blue is certainly going to say, I'd add that it was done specifically focused on D&amp;D, and that at this point it is years and years old. Really, it was done in 99 right? Like before 3.0, 3.5, WoW, the Forge Booth, the d20 glut, and everything else. Which makes me wonder if even were it accurate when made, how much it is still valid and how much is valid to us out here in the long tail. <br/><br/>My other contribution will be thus: I think there is more overlap between the groups then we're talking about ATM. I know that many folks I play with, have corresponded with, and talk to online do some degree of both. There certainly are data points at clustered at the extreme, but that doesn't mean there isn't a middle connecting them. Plus, one of the reason I like Indie games is a lot of them let me create and participate in more equal measure -- everyone gets to be more GMful and more playerish either at once or in cycles, rather than anyone being stuck in one position all the time.                        </div>

                            JBR, I think your Doom And Gloom is only true if indie game designers prove as conservative as mass-market roleplaying publishers in adapting to a new market and/or new areas of creative opportunity.  I have a large amount of faith that many indie RPG designers are ready to make the jump to whatever comes next for us.  Some people may not ever be ready and some people may talk longer than others to move on from this current stage of indie game publishing, since they have strong roots here.  I don't think that's any surprise or anything wrong with it.  After all, this stage is sturdy, well-mapped out, and will be successful and profitable for many years to come yet.  But some folks already have their eyes out for what's next and that's important too.  There will be risks in exploring and trying to build new markets in new areas, but that's what makes it exciting.  So, yeah.  Gloom if you want.  I'm not worried at all.  Bring on the future.                        </div>

                            I think we're in agreement, Jonathan, in most of it.  The only catch, for me, is that indie games have historically been something of a parasite on a market that was marshalled together by somebody else.  Seriously: we steal players (and customers) from mainstream gaming.  Sure, sometimes we get new players and such, but the majority are people who have played D&amp;D, GURPS, or CoC before.  If indie games go the "building new markets" route, that's not just writing a new kind of game -- that's writing a new kind of game, perhaps publishing it in a new way, certainly distributing it in a new way, and promoting it in a completely different way.  IPR and the Forge Booth are great, but they are baby steps compared to what would need to be done to "build a new market."  That's all totally foreign territory -- and I doubt it's something that can be done as anything less than a full-time job fueled by capital investment.<br/><br/>So, really: "build a new market" -- sounds fun, and I'm all for it, but it's a very, very big thing.                        </div>

New market would be ... no IS (because we're trying and failing, frankly) a ridiculous challenge that I frankly doubt our indie model will ever successfully surmount. It'll take "big" money (which isn't really big) to tackle that, I suspect. That, or an absurdly long period of long-tail marketing.                        </div>

<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2402&amp;page=1#Item_27" rel="nofollow">When I was putting together my gaming group's census data (out of 47 people), I noticed a few things. Check out:</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>- EXPERIENCE (years): </b> [5] 1, [3] 2-5, [12] 5-10, [22] 10-20, [5] 20+<br/>
<b>- GAME MASTER: </b> [23] Often, [6] Sometimes, [18] Never<br/>
<b>- MMORPGS: </b> [6] Often, [9] Sometimes, [32] Never<br/>
<br/>
24 out of 29 who have Game Mastered above, also play indie games.<br/>
13 out of 18 who have never GMed above, never play indie games.<br/>
The 5 above who have never GM but do play indie games, are also new players (playing 1 year or less).<br/>
12 out of 15 who play MMORPGS, have never GMed.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't polled this but I believe a huge portion of those who do GM also:<br/>
- tend to work, participate, or have interest in some sort of creative field (writing, acting, drawing).<br/>
- when not GMing, tend to play characters that have special powers that they can be creative with, such as magic users.<br/>
<br/>
This all loosely reminds me of what Robin Laws wrote here:

<div class="QuoteText">DUNGEONS AND OTHER UNSTRUCTURED ADVENTURES<br/>
Despite the inroads narrative-oriented games like Call of Cthulhu and Vampire have made over the years, most gamers still cut their teeth on plot-free adventures of exploration, action, and looting. The ultimate expression of this adventure type is the dungeon. Dungeons are great for starting GMs, because they donâ€™t have to worry about plot at all. The plot consists of the arbitrary order in which the PCs decide to knock down doors and beat up the monsters behind them.<br/>
<br/>
Although storyteller types find them utterly unsatisfying, your particular group may like them just fine. One of the big advantages of the unstructured adventure is that itâ€™s dead easy to create. Each area is a discrete and separate unit. You can add a new room to your dungeon complex at any time. You donâ€™t need to weave a complicated plot or worry about dispensing clues at the right rate. You donâ€™t have to play a bunch of different NPCs, keeping their motivations and funny voices straight. Your main concern lies in game balance, in making sure that the adversaries the PCs find behind the doors they bash down are neither too easy or too hard to vanquish, and that they treasures they guard are properly keyed to the charactersâ€™ current power level. Any rules set that supports this style of play makes these decisions easy for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your players like the dungeon-crawling style of play, let no one convince you that thereâ€™s anything wrong with it. It is probably still true that the majority of roleplayers active today prefer unstructured, exploratory adventures. Most roleplayers still play Dungeons and Dragons, and use the dungeon style of play it best supports.<br/>
<br/>
This style is popular because itâ€™s easy to run, and because it perfectly suits butt-kickers, power gamers, most specialists and casual types, and appeals reasonably well to tacticians. However, when storytellers and method actors first encounter plot and characterization, they experience an epiphany and drift off in search of games that better serve them.<br/>
<br/>
<b>A drawback of the unstructured style is that GMs get tired of running it sooner than players tire of playing it. Because the hundredth dungeon encounter you design is more or less like the tenth, the adventure creation process gets monotonous after a while. The ease of the dungeon style turns out to be a mixed blessing, too; many come to find it insufficiently challenging. GMs are disproportionately likely to be storytellers themselves, and want to introduce intricate plots, play weird NPCs, and show off their lovingly detailed worlds.</b></div>

                            JBR, I think the vast majority of crafting hobbies are not really audience-oriented, and produce artifacts that have only notional utility. The process is the point for most of the crafters I have known. Likewise, folk music sings have no audience other than the participants and no product. Really, an awful lot of hobby activities seem to me to fall into that "creative, but not product-oriented" zone.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>What about the Society for Creative Anachronism?</blockquote>
Josh, the SCA is a many-splendored thing.  For most SCA fighting play, there is no non-SCA audience, although public fighting demos are a well-established recruiting practice.  This slice of the SCA is very much "a relatively large-scale, self-perpetuating leisure activity that is highly creative and collaborative."<br><br>edit: and it's into at least its second generation now.<br><br>There are lots of other bits in the SCA that are more like knitting or quilting groups.  There's tons and tons of crafty stuff going on in the Society.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Matt, <br><br>It's been about seven years since the original survey, so I had a hard time tracking down my original document.  The link below reproduces it in total.<br><br/>Needless to say, Ryan Dancey did not much appreciate my critique.  And here, nearly a decade later, I am wishing I had spent more time editting.<br/>That said, reviewing the text,  I still find the concerns valid.  In my current role, a good 25-50% of my time dedicated to survey research and my current perspective doesn't change my opinion.<br/><br/><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.frp.moderated/msg/cf3a3df9886c0840" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.frp.moderated/msg/cf3a3df9886c0840</a>?<br/><br/>Now that I am home and the kids are off to bed, I will read the thread in more detail and comment more in a sepearate entry.                        </br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite><b>What that means to story gamers</b><br/>1) .... This gap explains much, from my perspective. The vast majority of gamers either do not realize story games exist, or they actively want nothing to do with them. </blockquote>
From anecdotal evidence from today:  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/roleplayers/1112659.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/roleplayers/1112659.html</a> I would say that this is true to a certain extent. 
<blockquote>It leads me to re-label the "game master" group. It represents very well the split I observed in Point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above. I have referred to this in the past as The Great Divide.<br/><br/>On one side, we have "traditional gamers." By and large, they want to celebrate and observe things they enjoy. The want less to<i>create</i>and<i>imagine</i>and more to<i>partake</i>and<i>reinforce</i>. By definition, they're not interested in imagination (Dancey refers to this very specifically.)<br/><br/>On the other side, we have what I'll call the creators. Most started out in traditional RPG circles. Most remain there. Some are frustrated. Some have moved "over here" to story games (the hobby, not necessarily the forum) and indie games.</blockquote>
This resonates with me very strongly.  As to your suggested times for "Indie Swells" (my term).  <br/>I suspect this represents a shift, in part, from when Mr. Dancey did his original research.  2000, while certainly not in the dark ages of the internet, was a long time ago in terms of independent publishing the way (at least) I think of it today. I recall discussion about PDF- and POD- publishing, but the reality was (for example) Nobilis (originally published by Pharos Press in 1999) didn't take off until Hogshead gave it a more professional release in 2002.  Hogshead was even then far from a big publisher, but if you see the two editions, you see a real difference between POD then, professional publishing then, and POD now.
<blockquote><br/><b>The bummer of the Great Divide</b><br/><br/>The real down side to this split is that we have two tangetially interacting groups. When one side observes the other doing something they don't like, the result is a culture clash that often takes the form of internet pissing matches. Watch Chris Pramas get really angry and dismissive of Ron Edwards. Watch people criticize RPGnet as a sewer. And so on. The Great Divide is indeed a divisive. This is unnecessary. It appears to also be unavoidable.<br/></blockquote>
I would argue that this divise impact is at least in part due to modern (American) culture. We are a country currently looking for "the other guys" to be wrong to demonstrate that "we" are right. It is unfortunate and I find it disappointing, but from my perspective it appears to be our current reality.  Would "Traditional gamers" and "Creators" clash without that influence?  Probably, but the culture certainly doesn't help in my opinion.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, and this is my opinion and one I've held for some time now.  I believe I generated it about the same time this research came out the first time.  Role-Playing is a hobby industry.  In other hobby industries, there tend to be two types of businesses that make money - the mass producers and the custom-designers.  Take for example, surfing or skateboarding (both which I know little about, so bear with me).  Certainly, if I want to enter the hobby of surfing or skateboarding, I can go to a local store and buy a mass-produced board.  My board will be essentially the same as every other board produced in that lot. Now, suppose I stick with the hobby.  I could stick with that board or get another just like it, but sooner-or-later, I'm going to discover that someone in town makes custom boards. At that point, I have a decision to make.  I can stick with my old-tried-and-true board, or I can go out on a limb and invest in a custom board.<br/><br/>I see the WotC's and the White Wolf's as the mass-producers of the gaming biz. D&amp;D and Storyteller both started in little shops "on the beach", but they've long since moved to a "factory".  Both provide perfectly servicable products - I have and expect to continue to get many years of enjoyment out of their products.  But I've evolved in my gaming hobby to a place where I want more.  I want to create my own games and barring not having the focusable time to do that, I want to explore custom games.  I see the creators and communities like this one and Forge as my local custom surf shop.<br/><br/>Can the two types of businesses co-exist?  Certainly.  Will the big guys always throw their weight around in an effort to absorb or destroy the little guys?  That's been true, as far as I can tell, for as long as there have been competitors in anything resembling a free-market economy.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, I REALLY love the idea of doing market research around gaming purchases - as long as it is done right.  I think there is a lot of interesting data to be gleaned, and I would love to compare today's environment to 2000. Unfortunately, unless one of you runs a professional survey research firm on the side, we are probably not in a position to do such research any time soon.<br/><br/><br/>Blue                        </div>

                            I turned to Indie games in my 30's, and not due to any dearth of opportunity to play. It had to do with me wanting to give Brand a chance to play games he was interested in, and to equitably support his games the way he supported mine.<br/><br/>I did settle down with an SO, and this resulted in more and longer games than I'd been playing before. It did however make for smaller, more focus game groups in general as my appetite for 5+ player games diminished.<br/><br/>I did however turn away some of the behavior of previous groups. My game tastes matured earlier (probably because I'm a slight bit older) than some folks I was playing with, and this did demand several changes in the kinds of games I play, who I play them with and how I approach them.<br/><br/>I do think we're overstating the divide between trad and indie games as demographics. I mean, when I look over on the Your Gaming Census thread, I see a whole lot of games of both stripes represented, and only three people who report playing exclusively indie games.<br/><br/>I do think John has a big point around GMing and hippy games as a possible pointer. Even though Brand had been trying to get me to engage in hippy games for about a year before I did, it was only when I started pointing my efforts towards GMing that I started to really plug in, and it wasn't playing the games that made me focus on them, but thinking about the possibility of running them. Even when I started GMing, I went to a trad game first, and it was after that experience that hippy games became more appealing. Also, their indie-ness rather than their nar-ness or their forge-ness or their hippy-ness that got me more interested, because their indie-ness made me think about how different approaches to design could support different playstyles. It was only after that that I really got into things and learned that I had a love on for Dogs and for keys in TSOY, and for a handful of other things out there.<br/><br/>I personally think that hippy games (not all, but by and large) are daunting to the people out there that don't GM. They break down trad GM constructs to re-distribute power and responsibility to the whole group. This in itself is a terrific thing, but it doesn't provide, by and large, any real training or support for those folks who never had those skills in the first place. What's more, in doing so, it can muck around with redistribution of power without regard for the playstyles that have been working for a lot of non-GM's for a long time.<br/><br/>Oh, and JBR: You have hurt my heart very badly. You made a cheese reference. I didn't know your soul was dead. I'll be sure to send flowers to Laura. Poor thing, she.                        </div>

                            I apologize if this is tangental, but I feel a need to respond to the dire picture some posters are painting of the future of story gaming and the gaming industry in general.<br/>
<br/>
Call me an optimist, but I think the audience for story games can only grow larger as time passes.  Here in the US, we have a growing demographic of elderly retirees.  As the population ages, this demographic grows larger and larger.  The same mechanic applies to the gaming population.  Even if the majority of maturing gamers turn to MMOs for a quick fix or simply turn off, I suspect there will always be a percentage that want to hang in there and look for something new.  If the story gaming community continues to evangelize for itself, that percentage will find it.  <br/>
<br/>
At worst, that means the hobby is probably self-sustaining.  However, the key factor to growth here is user retention.  I can really only speak for myself on this point, but I suspect most of you feel the same way.  To me, gaming and telling stories is not merely a diversion, it is a lifestyle.  I love games, and cannot foresee getting bored or giving up on this hobby.  Ever.  If this mindset is as prevalent amongst story gamers as I suspect it is, the audience for this type of game will continue to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua:<br/>
<br/>
In regards to story gaming being a "parasite" of mainstream gaming, it is true -- story gaming has drawn and will continue to draw its audience from the traditional player base.  Like parasites in nature, the story gaming community has a symbiotic relationship with its mainstream host.  In my opinion, that is a plus, not a minus.  If one can expect a small but steady stream of bored, creative gamers to trickle into the indie community, then the community has a guaranteed source of new blood.                        </div>

I foresee something akin to what David said about skateboards. The mid-tier, RPG-only company is going to die (hence <a href="http://freeport-pirate.livejournal.com/49228.html" rel="nofollow">Chris Pramas' general angst</a>). We'll then have the WotCs and WWs making the big, shiny stuff you can find at Barnes &amp; Noble at one end, and the Rons and Lukes doing the DIY thing at the other. And I think this is going to really good for everyone who enjoys RPGs.<br/><br/>The remaining issue is that the Green Ronins and Hero Games of the world need to figure out at which end they want to take up residence.                        </div>

                            Generally, Iâ€™m sitting here and nodding my head to what Matt and many others are saying, except for one thing. Gamers, even gamer-partakers <i>are</i> creative and imaginiative. They create their characters, and some of them go into a great detail over backstory and exposition. They regularly come up with imaginative solutions to problems in-game. And they enjoy both of these activities, in tabletop and MMO play. Failing to recognise these traits is missing the market. I think Tony nailed some of this right at the beginning of the thread.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, most players do not enjoy being the GM, because GMing requires a much broader skillset. For example, active listening, resolving disagreements between players, world creation, incorporating other peopleâ€™s input and building upon it. I think this is exactly why story-gaming appeals more to GMs than non-GMs, it also hits those skills full-on. For non-GMs, itâ€™s hard work.<br/>
<br/>
There are also people who would be attracted to the worldbuilding and creative riffing that story games encourage, if it wasnâ€™t for all those rules and dice. Many of these end up in LARP or IRC freeform gaming because the rules get in the way less.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, there is a divide â€“ but it may not be the divide that Dancey (and many of us) think it is.<br/>
<br/>
Other things to consider: a lot of GM skills could be considered to be <i>management</i> skills (as in skills that a good manager of other people should have). I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a coincidence that corporate â€œrole-playsâ€ are still popular (with the companies at least. Maybe not so much with the staff, who are unlikely to be attending the role-play of their own free will.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, young children also exhibit a lot of these skills, and (I believe) are often far better negotiators and team workers than adolescents.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think that the â€œevolutionâ€ from traditional gaming to story gaming is similar to the evolution of traditional classroom teaching (I talk, you listen and reply) into trainee-led workshops (I facilitate, you talk).<br/>
<br/>
So, what does this mean for the (real or perceived) story gaming market? Firstly, there are some design considerations, many of which we are familiar with. If you want to reach out into the wider market, it is generally a good idea to make sure that your games:<br/>
<br/>
1)	Have rules that are easy to learn and drop into the background during play.<br/>
2)	Provide active support for creative expression and interaction between players.<br/>
3)	Have an interesting setting or premise that people will want to add their own fiction to.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, marketing. If you ever want story gaming to hit the big time, you have to get away from the adolescent audience (who are more interested in self-expression) and towards the child and adult audiences (who are more interested in group expression.) This is of course a massive generalisation and please forgive me for it, especially if you are of a certain age!                        </div>

I think Dancey was right.<br><br>I think there really-is a consume/partake group who don't particularly enjoy creating.<br><br>Partake = consume.     As in 'consumer product' or 'consume a meal'.<br><br>Sure, just about everyone will muster some ingenuity, if necessity dictates that the only way they can eat is to use their imagination and create a meal.<br><br>But that doesn't mean everyone enjoys cooking, given a choice to pay to be fed instead.<br><br>WotC's data told them that consumers are their most lucrative customers, not cooks.  So they focussed on being a restaurant, not a grocery store.<br><br><br>Dancey described a great mass of adolescents and college students with limited access to cars and cash.<br>So, to 'go places' they try rpgs.  Out of necessity, at first.   Some of those players quit the surrogate activity of rpgs as soon as they get cars and cash.<br>Others find that rpgs have ongoing appeal, and keep playing.<br><br>Why is that?   Is it because they discover something great and worthwhile in rpgs?  <br><br><b>Or, sadly, is it because those players continue to lead lives which lack in Real World satisfaction; and so Imaginary, Surrogate satisfaction remains the best they can obtain?  Is that the true core of the rpg hobby?</b> <br><br/><br/>That last point would apply no less to the Create/Imagine/GM group...<br/><br/>I agree that there's a segment who <b>do</b> actually Enjoy "imagining" and "GMing".   However, the word 'create' only belongs in there if you definite it narrowly to mean Create Imaginary Things. (Like stories and kingdoms and fictional characters).   <br/><br/>I'm saying that it's a mistake to think that the GM-class are flat-out more 'creative' and everybody-else is a partake/consume dullard.<br/><br/>I'm saying that some of the biggest Creator people are those who prefer to create Real World things, instead of Imaginary Things.   People who choose to hotrod a real car, instead of stat-out an imaginary one.    Those people probably only play rpgs out of necessity, during their carless cashless years.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            We're all colored by our experiences, so here's why I don't buy the doom and gloom.<br/>
<br/>
In the Eighties I started going to Hardcore/Punk shows. In the pit I could get elbowed by all types of folks; A goth kid with mascara and a leather skirt, a kid with spike bracelets and a Mohawk, a kid with a chainmail shirt and a jean jacket with the sleeves ripped off and a Metallica patch on the back, a kid with a black leather jacket and a hand painted Ministry album cover on the back, a Skin, a Suicidal, a pre-Riot Grrrrl,  a regular looking kid, blah blah blah. All types of people. Kids liked what we built, and as more entered the "scene" eventually disparate groups branched off and built their own thing. Even Hardcore got somewhat separated from Punk Rock. Today Hardcore and Punk Rock do not display this diversity. They are stratified and established. Evolution comes slow now, but their size hasn't changed. It goes through cycles, but overall it's stable. However, there are so many more options for the weird kids, outside of Hardcore, than there were then.<br/>
<br/>
To me it seems the same with RPG's. There are so many more people who enjoy controlling their protagonist, having some control over their imaginary life. MMORPG's, to a lesser extent video games in general, traditional games, LARP, Story Games, and whatever comes next. Think about MMO's and LARP's. There are whole groups of people involved in those mediums who would have never played a traditional game, because they would have lost tragic points or gained geek points.<br/>
<br/>
So if Clyde's theory of Punk Rock Gaming is true, the Traditional games aren't going anywhere, as long as they evolve slowly, and they are. D+D 3E is evolution, rumors of 4E being announced at Gen Con, White Wolf is evolving. Mid tier game companies have always come and later folded. I think we may see a stable market for Traditional Games, but I don't think they're going away. Companies are unlikely to appreciate stability, and I think that's their major threat to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to mention that if the majority of people are not creative or imaginative, then it would be really hard to deprotagonize them, since they have no creative vision to hold on to. If players are just consumers they'd be more likely to take what they're given, and this just doesn't seem to hold water to me. I think some folks are mistaking narrative and plot control for creativity. I think creativity is a bit larger than that.                        </div>

<p>The point to remember, here, is that Dancey never said players weren't imaginative. He said the majority of players <em>didn't care</em> about imagination. That's not why they play the game. If they do something creative during the game, they're fine with that, as long as: they don't feel pressured, they don't feel like they've put in more effort than it's worth, and they get what they really want (to partake.)</p>
<p>Given that, we shouldn't be in denial about this significant majority of gamers, nor should we be dismissive. Instead, consider this: can you design a game that allows creativity <em>for those who so desire</em>, but which supports the vast majority of gamers?</p>

Nobody suggested that the Passively Partaking Consumers (aka those not-especially-into-imagining) only occur in tabletop gaming.   Or that the hobby has more-such members than the general population.<br><br>The consumer/creator division was simply acknowledged to exist; and a correlation was noted; as-to which group drove most rpg sales. (The Consumers).<br> <br/><br/>However, I did suggest that the other segment-- people who particularly-do enjoy imagining-- may exemplify the core of the hobby.<br/>In that their passion for imagining may be due to lack of means to create in the Real World.  Whether due to lack of mobility and cash (like a student)<br/>or due to other, lifelong factors-- which limit their ability to create in Reality.                        </br></br></br></div>

Could it perhaps fulfill a need more like that of the casual guitar strummer or the painter that only paints for their own enjoyment, rather than any fame or cash? Not everyone is cut-out for even modest recognition in creative fields, yet it seems kind of a shame to completely give up on creative activities because of that.                        </div>

                            I firmly believe that nearly anyone can tell stories. Not all of us can tell the sorts of stories that will live in immortal literary legend, but we can all imagine things and tell about them. Not everyone enjoys doing this. But many people who will never, ever have the opportunity to do it in any "official", commercial, way still enjoy doing it.<br/><br/>Not everyone enjoys listening to stories, either. Some people can't suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it. Some people just don't care. But a lot of people enjoy listening to the products of other people's imagining, even if said projects aren't polished and perfect and brilliant. Especially if there's also the charge of intimacy that comes from the creator being someone you know.<br/><br/>I don't think that it's true that inside every GM there's a frustrated novelist taking out their frustration on a captive audience. I don't think inside every player there's a sad little brainwashed drone clutching at their piece of a pre-dicgested pre-fab fantasy product. I think that different people like different things about the creative process, and that nearly everybody has something to contribute to it if they want to.<br/><br/>So screw the art-snob stuff (especially that nasty little internal Art Snob so many of us have installed). Go Play.                        </div>

<p>I agree with you partway, Mark, except you're still linking "telling stories" to creativity. Lots of people in the RPG community do this. That's why we hear people talk about how storytelling is a dying art.</p>
<p>The number one pastime everywhere -- <em>everywhere</em> -- is storytelling. "Let me tell you what the boss did today..." "Man, I had this weird dream..." "Have you heard about Brad and Peggy?" "I heard this weird story on the news..." The problem is, very little of this storytelling fits the model of an action-adventure story, which is what most RPGs are based on. They often don't even resemble romance or drama, because their point is to convey some simple bit of information (my boss is stupid, dreams are weird.) Furthermore, creativity in this kind of storytelling is <em>embellishment</em>. Some people embellish their stories more than others; combined with good timing and a couple other talents, that's what we consider to be a good storyteller.</p>
<p>The roleplayers Dancey was talking about don't want to tell stories in the cinematic or literary sense. At most, they want to embellish an existing story. It has nothing to do with talent or brainwashing or consumerism. They just don't care about the same things many indie gamers care about. They want the story, if there is one, to be dictated by an outside source: GM, published adventure, or roll of the dice. Or, a computer and a gaggle of programmers. That's one reason why WoW does so well. If you want to market to them, make a game that does the plot <em>for</em> them, improves their ability to <em>embellish</em> without requiring it, and makes both of these processes easier but better than computer games.</p>
<p>And if you want to market to people who haven't been interested in roleplaying games yet, make a game that fits one of the storytelling patterns people already use in real life, but add more fun. Do "My Day At Work". Don't call it a roleplaying game, though, even if it is one; just make a game that lets people embellish an unfolding series of events with stuff they've actually experienced or heard of.</p>

                            Great thread, thanks Matt for starting it!<br/>
<br/>
Regarding WoW: I don't think that gamers play it for the story. They play it for killing the monsters, looting the huge dungeons and especially developing a cool character over time. The fact that this can be done with other human players to which you can show your character (and that you know they will be able to appreciate) is a huge boost.<br/>
At least that's why my friends play, even if some appreciate the "roleplay" that happens from time to time (which from what I've seen is a lot of showing off and little story, often used in recruitment).<br/>
<br/>
Before MMORPGs, I believe one could find those elements best in TRPGs. Now one can choose. MMORPGs have a lot of advantages over TRPGs, especially a design better suited to that goal.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of GMs actively bring down players who show off (often called Munchkins or something like that) in order to "get on with the story".<br/>
<br/>
No wonder those players leave the TRPG media.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about the creativity issue. Seen from one angle, it takes a lot of creativity to make an interesting character to show off and that will be appreciated in the team (aka: guild or clan in MMORPGs).<br/>
It's perhaps a different kind of creativity from storytelling, but writing those players off as just partakers might miss the mark about the way they like to participate in games.<br/>
And I'm not even sure that it's that far off from storytelling, since in a TRPG, the story will be about the characters nonetheless in a way that it isn't in a MMORPG.<br/>
<br/>
To gain interest back from some of these players, one might need to design games where the GM does have a lot of control over the story's background, but in such a way that a player can easily insert his character coolness <i>even if</i> that means changing bits of the story.<br/>
<i>D&amp;D 3.x</i> and, possibly, <i>Exalted</i> have such a solution in some regards.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, even this might not be enough to outweigh cool graphics and music, the possibility to play whenever you feel like it without depending on other players, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 Â¢<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Matt Snyder, I have a question for you: how is this issue different from Creative Agendas? After all, this smells a lot of a clash between Gamism and Narrativism (and both are <i>Creative</i> Agendas) and I might be blinding myself to the real issue with this parallel I'm drawing.                        </div>

Bah.  They do it to compare their e-penises.  I've been playing MMORPGs since 2000, and I can tell you that's what the games are all about.  How big's your weapon?  How many hit points you got?  What are your resistances?  Is the same thing no matter what game, and I've played just about all of them.  MMORPGs satisfy the gaming need for the kind of person who A) likes killing monsters and taking their stuff, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> can't find any play group in their area but want *something* like roleplay, C) are computer game-aholics, or D) loves to compare himself to others and see how superior he is.<br><br>Peace,<br><br>-Troy                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            &gt;&gt;If indie games go the "building new markets" route, that's not just writing a new kind of game -- that's writing a new kind of game, perhaps publishing it in a new way, certainly distributing it in a new way, and promoting it in a completely different way. IPR and the Forge Booth are great, but they are baby steps compared to what would need to be done to "build a new market." That's all totally foreign territory -- and I doubt it's something that can be done as anything less than a full-time job fueled by capital investment.                        </div>

                            Thats easy. Going to print 1,000,000 copies of a full color introductory edition of the game that is fully playable and then going to seed that production run across as much of the core market as I can. Once we get our legs under us with that program, we'll print another million and will seed it through a non core channel. Then another million and through another channel and so on and so forth until we've literally saturated as much of America and Europe that we can and still make the program meet its goals.<br>
<br>
There is a LOT more to that plan than that, but some of it we sort of want to surprise the market with, so want to keep it quite until we're ready to go ahead with the full plan. One just has to ask ones self on how you can get independent retailers and mass market chains invested in working with you to distribute the intro games and how we might turn that into a both a profit for us and strategic long term placement for the brand we want.<br>
<br>
Going to be a heck of a lot of work...<br>

                            Christoph, I'm going to think on that excellent question. For now, I'll say that I observe healthy G and S play among the "partakers" and healthy N and G play among the Creators. Thus, I reason, the divide is not defined by creative agenda. (I do consider it possibly, but unlikely, that the divide might be defined by groupings of creative agendas -- like the G and S combo above.)<br><br>Ryan, with all due respect, I think you're wildly over-estimating the possible market. I do not see your product far eclipsing unit sales moved by, say, Wizards of the Coast, even if you actually give it away as a marketing effort (I advise against that, as the perceived value of your product by customers will be poor). If you do intend it as a marketing effort, make certain you have a percentage of return and well-founded reason to believe that is accurate. For example, direct mail campaigns by major magazines devoted to hobbyists and enthusiasts consider a 1% rate of return an extraordinary success. I suspect you will not consider that sufficient, as an example.<br><br>Please consider listening to much advice on this topic, and deliberately seek it out from experienced publishers in and out of the hobby. It would be a huge mistake to dismiss critiques of your extremely, extremely ambitious plans as ignorant naysayers. I am profoundly skeptical you will achieve your aims. This is me, advising you respectfully, that you are likely to lose money on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's none of my business, but I'd hate to see you take on serious financial hardship.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Assuming your numbers are correct, I would think the marketing budget required to see the 5%-10% rate of return (which is HUGE) you'd need to sell all the copies of your game is going to be WAY beyond the $150,000 you mentioned earlier.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>It has the most successful RPG mostly by virtue of having the first RPG.</blockquote>
There are more reasons than this.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>We like to regard ourselves as experienced publishers too, since we've been at it since 1994.</blockquote>
Ryan, is there a particular region in which your products are especially popular? I ask simply because, despite having been very active in online RPG communities for the last ten years (Usenet, RPG.net, ENWorld, S-G, Forge, various publisher's boards), a rabid RPG magazine consumer, review reader/writer, and a small con organizer, I have never heard of nor seen any of your products before. (Save possibly <i>Button Wars</i>, which sounds familiar. I could be getting it confused with Diskwars.)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>And actually, short putting up the capital to get the venture rolling, is actually a self sustaining model without selling a single copy of the core box set.</blockquote>
I have no idea how this is possible, but if so, I'm glad to see your company is secure.<br/><br/>Can you tell us something about the game? You mentioned races; is this a FRPG in the vein of D&amp;D? If so, what differentiates it?<br/><br/>FYI, I'm not trying to be snarky or hyper-critical. I guess I'm just astounded.                        </div>

<i>JBR, I think your Doom And Gloom is only true if indie game designers prove as conservative as mass-market roleplaying publishers in adapting to a new market and/or new areas of creative opportunity. I have a large amount of faith that many indie RPG designers are ready to make the jump to whatever comes next for us.</i><br/><br/>One of the real strengths of being an indie pub is that you have such low overhead that you can afford to be flexible.  Conservatism is a function of entrenchment in industry: if my company has to pay millions of dollars to buy an up to date database for my workers, we will instead stick with the one operating on DOS. If I've only got 3 workers, I'll upgrade every year and move to the innovative systems when I can. Closer to home, doing what White Wolf has done is risky. By doing the reboot to their setting they are basically making obselete the investment people have made in their systems.  I'm sure they will get plenty of new purchases from it, but nonetheless it was a risky move. It's why Film Studios do so many film versions of novels. It's less of a risk to re-tread proven material than to try something new when you're already deeply invested.  <br/><br/>So, indie means small and maneuverable.  Tailor made to shift with changes in technology, form innovation and user preference.  <br/><br/>The parasite comment also struck me as misguided. What indie games are, instead, is a niche market.  Small producers have a huge advantage over large mass-market producers, if they can find a niche and provide a unique product that is too difficult or expensive to be produced at a mass scale.  The more the small producers try to capture the mass market, the less they are able to fulfill the needs of their (real) target audience, and the more they come into competition with cats that are way out of their scale.  Custom skateboards as a metaphor are right on.    <br/><br/>And as far as changes necessarily putting small producers a form out of business, think about indie mini-comics.  How many people had read them outside of maker/user circles in the 80s/90s? Few.  Now think about the audiences for webcomics.  Huge.                        </div>

Wow, Emily!  I just made a <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2007/02/what-is-future-of-rpgs.html" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> about this very thing.  I have read several people's take on the last year of gaming (Tevis, Hite, Dancey, etc) and some of them talk about how table-top RPG is becoming a dying breed and electronic games are taking over.  RPGs aren't dying, IMO, they are changing.  And the people best suited to take advantage of these changes are independant publishers, just as you say.  The thing is, we need to be couragous enough to embrace these new trends as they come and take full advantage of them.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>The parasite comment also struck me as misguided.</blockquote>It may have a negative connotation but it's true to the extent that indie games depend on people who've already been drawn to the hobby by "mainstream" games, either as a first-order market or as a "vector" for introducing non-gamers. When you start having non-gamers spontaneously pick up indie games off the shelf and playing them, and people without "mainstream" experience bringing in non-gamers, then indie games become self-sustaining. I don't think things have quite reached that point.                        </div>

                            Hi,<br/><br/>Some quick queries, more for my clarification than anything else.<br/><br/>Is creation being linked to actual design of games?  It's not clear to me here, but I think that would miss a trick.  Providing someone with tools which they could use to create their own content is still enabling someone to be a creator, it's just that they create content rather than medium (or content rather than medium and content).<br/><br/>I think the consumption model plainly drives much of current and recent (as in last ten-fifteen years or so) rpg marketing.  The concept of metaplot is a consumption based model, in which the gamer purchases precreated content and then experiences it with his or her group.  Adventure modules historically provided a similar role, and have had something of a resurgence of late with the arrival of 3/3.5e.<br/><br/>PTA to get concrete is an example of a game which provides a medium with which the consumer then creates their own content, it is not a passive tool, it is an enabling tool giving creative control to the purchaser following purchase.  That's key, not everyone has the time, inclination or indeed ability to create their own media, their own game engines.  PTA assists with that by providing a flexible engine that then empowers those individuals with the ability to get on with creating that which they do have the time, inclination and/or ability to create - the actual content.<br/><br/>Consumption comes in two forms incidentally, consumption through play and consumption through collecting.  I don't think there is a trad/indie split on these but that's tangential.  Consumption through play means buying a product and consuming the experience that comes with that product.  Both classic WoD and say The Mountain Witch seem to me to aim at consumption through play, there is relatively little left in terms of creative input from consumers.<br/><br/>Classic WoD also exemplifies the consumption through collection model, consumers purchased the metaplot books not necessarily to play them but merely to read and own them.  Near the end, marketing fluff for OWoD expressly referred to this market of non-playing consumers.  I think the indie market also has this phenomenon, but I don't think (happily) anyone in the indie market creates with a view to selling on this basis.<br/><br/>So on my take there, we have four categories of gamer interaction.<br/><br/>Those who create media and content.<br/><br/>Those who do not create media, but wish tools with which to create content.<br/><br/>Those who consume through play.<br/><br/>Those who consume through collection.<br/><br/>Naturally there is some overlap.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think it's unlikely that there is a GNS element to this, I think it's GNS independent, I certainly wouldn't see any link between say a preference for one CA and a preference for consumption or creation.<br/><br/>Oh, really lastly this time, I think the early hobby favoured a creation based model, with early rpgs aiming to give tools to enable creation.  I think in the 90's we moved to a consumer model, and are still in that by and large, save in the indie community where there has been a revival in large part of the model in which one provides tools to enable creativity (though some indie games plainly seem to me essentially consumer focussed).<br/><br/>I also don't see a value judgement, a great game may deliver a prepackaged experience and still be a great game, it's just a different kind of beast than a game which enables creation.                        </div>

                            I can't quote for some reason, anyway, Talysman said:<br/><br/>"Given that, we shouldn't be in denial about this significant majority of gamers, nor should we be dismissive. Instead, consider this: can you design a game that allows creativity for those who so desire, but which supports the vast majority of gamers?"<br/><br/>The game that strikes me as notably doing this is D&amp;D.  Bear with me a moment.<br/><br/>D&amp;D can be played without any roleplaying at all, it can be played as a pure tactical boardgame, in which one player references a pre-purchased adventure containing locations and encounters while the other players maneouver their play pieces through the same seeking to survive and prosper.  Basically, a game like Descent.<br/><br/>D&amp;D can also be played as a game in which the engine serves to support play, but the core of play is the creation by one or more participants of a world and story that speaks to them.<br/><br/>Note, in the same group, one or more players could be interested in using it as a tool to create content, a tool for generating their own fantasy epics that speak to them, while others in the same group could be treating it as an elaborate boardgame.<br/><br/>I think part of the success of D&amp;D historically, aside from the obvious advantages of being first and having immense brand recognition, is precisely that it requires no creativity at all but permits the expression of creativity fairly easily.  In particular, within the same group it is easy for some players to be using it as a creativity enabler while others are using it as a source of prepackaged content.<br/><br/>Other games could do the same thing, but most don't, D&amp;D is actually slightly unusual in the extent to which it permits utterly uncreative play.  The essential point is that the game can be played with no roleplaying at all, that you can play it as a boardgame should that be your wish without anyone creating any actual content of their own.  Once you have that, I think you have a game with potential to bridge a consumer/creator gap.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if any indie games currently manage that divide, I think vanishingly few trad games do.  Most require someone at some stage to create their own content to at least a minimal degree, D&amp;D doesn't necessarily.<br/><br/>Edit:  This isn't rpg.net so hopefully this won't be an issue, but to be clear I'm saying that a strength of D&amp;D is that it can be played with no creative input, I am not saying in the slightest that people who do play D&amp;D actually make no creative input.  This isn't a slam on D&amp;D players or saying they suxxors while storygames rule (again, hopefully not necessary to state here, but I'd hate to derail things with someone passionately defending D&amp;D from an attack that wasn't being made).                        </div>

Mark, I broadly agree with your additional comment there, I think it's because D&amp;D is now being explicitly aimed at a consumer audience more than was historically the case.  Historically I think it was a bit of an accident it worked that way, whereas now we have a company with a research and marketing budget looking at how to adapt the game so as to maximise sales.  That leads to different outcomes by its nature.<br/><br/>Edit:  Put another way, WotC would probably be happy if nobody played the game at all if in the process somehow it shifted more units, whereas Vincent Baker (to take a basically random example) would not I suspect be happy to churn out content aimed at sales rather than play.  Happily, for now at least, WotC sees the money being in play rather than collection, which view I think they are correct in.<br/><br/>Edit 2, the sequel.  Rather depressingly, I was originally going to cite Chaosium rather than Vincent Baker, then I remembered how much of their stuff was written by people who don't play and realised it probably wasn't true of them in the way it was for Vincent.  Rather a tangential point, but a depressing one given my fondness for CoC.                        </div>

                            Hey Eliot,<br/><br/><i>At best it's commensalism. At present, indies thrive on a market created by the big companies. Arguably that's also true of most "mid-tier" outfits, indie or not.</i><br/><br/>So indie films are parasitic on mainstream films? Indie comics, indie music? In all of these industries it is actually the mainstream that "feeds" off of the indie streams: big sneaker and clothes corporations go to inner city informants to find out what the breaking trends are, and copy them on a large scale.  Film studios start "indie" lines of their own to capitalize on the successes of styles innovated by small scale film makers. <br/><br/>Commensalism seems much more accurate, although both are actually helped by the interaction. I'd go with, symbiosis as Judd said. Smaller producers have the freedom to innovate, and these improvements are adopted by the larger firms and brought to a larger audience.  <br/><br/>Sometimes. : )<br/><br/>Troy, I'll have to check out your post!                        </div>

Oh man, I just watched an A&amp;E special on this.  There are consultants who get paid HUGE ammounts of money to go out and find "trend-setter" teens who make their own clothes and their own music.  They take pictures and music samples of these kids and show them to companies like Sony, Sprite, Abbercrombe, etc and then the board members make a descision whether to follow the trend or not.  I mean it is unbelievable how much money there is in locating niche, trend setting groups and then taking it mainstream.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Emily, it doesn't really matter what biological analogy we use, it's just an analogy. In that vein I also wouldn't look to indie films or comics to demonstrate anything about indie games, although they can be suggestive along the lines you mention. Ideas and personnel coming up from the grassroots probably do benefit the big producers somewhat by helping them to reach and maintain a wider audience. But I took Joshua's original comment and your reply as referring to the market side of things. The benefit that indies provide to the bigs here is harder to ascertain. Simply providing some variety of play may prevent "gamer burnout", so that people come back to D&amp;D refreshed and ready to buy more. Maybe. But my impression of the bulk of the indie market is that D&amp;D or WoD brought people in, and only then did they discover indie games. That's hardly surprising given the timeframe, but in the long run it will matter quite a bit to the viability of indie gaming both as a commercial activity and as a hobby. If the market for the "big" games shrinks to a fraction of what it is currently, then indie games will have to start creating their own markets and indie gamers looking for fellow players will have to recruit non-gamers on a larger scale than I suspect is currently happening.                        </div>

I think oWoD re-acquired former gamers who'd played D&amp;D as kids, but were looking for something cooler, maturer (is that a word?), and hipper now that they were older.<br/><br/>Um, okay, that's probably just me...                        </div>

I think it's true to some degree because they're extremely ubiquitous (Poker and Chess particularly).  <br/><br/>However, most board or card games that I play are <i>not</i> transferred.  I buy the game, read the rules, and try it out.  I might have read a review of the game online or had someone recommend it to me, but I don't play with anyone who has played before.                        </div>

WW wasn't trying to work outside the existing distribution system, though. I.e., they were putting their books in stores and whatnot, whereas indie RPGs have been a very grassroots, 'Net-focused thing, as I understand it.                        </div>

Which would be an awfully sexy outcome, actually.Yes, actually, I think it would be great for a variety of reasons if indie games could develop their own self-sustaining market, regardless of what happens to the "big" players. (I don't think it would be good for the bigs to shrink, because I like what they do.) But if indie games (or story games, they're not exactly the same category but I think the same analysis applies either way) <i>can't</i> make that transition--if they really depend on the prior existence of "experienced and/or jaded gamers" that they had no hand in creating, then basically if D&amp;D stops recruiting people into the "mainstream" hobby, the niche or commensal or symbiote of indie games will also disappear.<br/><br/>This is not like, e.g., the evolution of wargames and RPGs. Wargames have basically stopped recruiting, but on the other hand they long ago ceased to be the primary vector for introduction of people into the RPG hobby. So no big deal, except that many of the same things that brought about the decline of the wargame market are having a delayed effect on the RPG market.                        </div>

                            Pretty much it depends on if we can go from being the long tail of "those who bought WoD also bought..." and to a thing all our own. Various brands of indie music have done this, others haven't. Right now I've got some hope for us, as Indie games are getting a good chunk of diversity and there are some people who are willing to take personal, creative, and financial risks to try new things. Worked right, this can turn into the kind of targeted marketing that Troy is bringing up. The problem with that is that in this day and age targeted marketing is being run by huge companies, the biggest are focusing on the smallest, because decentralized focal points work better in an unstable environment. So while we may not have to compete with mainstream companies there, we may have to compete with other companies selling products that compete for time and attention to people who already have too little of both. <br/><br/>Also, Max is right. There is a lot of cross-pollination between mainstream and Indie games at this point. It'll be interesting to see in 5 years who is left standing and how much of a difference there is between the (ha ha) "camps."                        </div>

                            Ryan, with all due respect, whatever you're doing is almost completely independent of the rest of the wargame hobby. I base this on reviews over at BoardGameGeek, links from Web Grognards, and comments at Consimworld. If you're growing your business, good for you, but the general point stands: the wargame companies basically market to people who are already acquainted with the hobby.<br/><br/>I don't know how long you've been in the hobby, however I can assure you that in the early days there was a healthy degree of "cross-recruitment" and synergy between RPGs and wargames. You can believe that or not, but the overall point is pretty much what you write in your last paragraph.                        </div>

                            That wargames and rpgs have diverged is pretty clear ( strictly, IMO) from that fact that wargamers and rpgers are largely unaware of experimentation be done by folks in the other hobby (IME).<br/><br/>Are WGs really dead in the water though?

                            Perhaps my bias in favor of the H&amp;C variety is coloring my perceptions. I've also noted the excitement over games like Memoir '44 but I haven't tried them, personally--so that, too, may be a personal blindspot. Nevertheless the secular trend from the 80's to the noughties is pretty stark. Wargames used to occupy a large amount of space at several local stores; nowadays the RPG sections are still respectable but the wargame portion has shrunken by 60%-100% I'd say.<br/><br/>But anyway, that's all pretty much beside the point. I like to use wargame paradigms in my thinking about RPGs; nevertheless, RPGs haven't really needed to feed off the wargame market for a long time. Though maybe in the future they could benefit from a re-union. Which reminds me, we were supposed to get together to talk about stuff like that. Let's try again.                        </div>

                            What is potentially interesting is that the internet changes some of the old models. First the internet is strong on disintermediation. It is actively challenging the business models of distributors because it enables consumers and producers to talk directly and cheaply. <br/><br/>A lot of the core rpg industry spent time and effort focusing on gaining access through distribution networks like bookstores when such networks were beginning to be eclipsed. The future for distributors and retailers is probably grim in an internet age. <br/><br/>The problem with the loss of the physical distribution is how do people hear about your products. I have doubts as to how many people wandered across rpgs by accident by virtue of their being located in a shop and how many heard about them from peer groups or mainstream media. I would suspect that the peak of entrants to the hobby occured at the same time that the mainstream media was reporting on it as a cultural phenomena, TRPGs were part of popular culture. I would guess there is a feedback loop at work in such phenomena. The more people that hear about the hobby, the more that participate. In that sense there was no such thing as bad publicity because a lot of the 'wierd freaks' and 'satanic'  propoganda increased awareness of the product. <br/><br/>While 'effort to play' might be an issue with TRPGs when faced with CRPGs I suspect 'awarness' and popularity help to. We do it because our friends are doing it and we want to be part of the gang. I'm sure that MMORPGs benefit this right now. Your buddies go join and so do you. I doubt that 'most' people are actively deciding against TRPG but just following the herd who have moved on to CRPG. <br/><br/>Social networking is the other great revolution of the internet and it potentially has helped indie games because it has given 'word-of-mouth' exposure to many games to a market that has a high-density of potential consumers. The danger is the ghetto unless those communities also introduce you to new ideas.  What is interesting to me is the potential of social networking to move MMORPG players to TRPG with the 'if you like that, try this' model. Of course the advantage here will be to those who exploit the strenghts of the different medium - social interaction, you create the story - but remain familiar to the MMORPG community.<br/><br/>Curiously I think there are parallels to the early days of the hobby when D&amp;D spread by social networking and had a first print run of 1,000 copies. We may be coming full circle to a hobby again. What is encouraging surely is that the hobby has existed at such levels in the past before, so  should be able to again.                        </div>

Do Clix, Warhammer, WarMachine, D&amp;D minis, and the like count? They seem to be kicking TRPG's collective ass.<br/>Those are the things I was thinking of when I mentioned a minor surge, while Elliot was thinking of Hex'n'Chip games. So, in a way, we're both right, depending on which wargame styles you ( the general you) are talking about.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>&gt;&gt;the wargame companies basically market to people who are already acquainted with the hobby.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>That is true of most of the companies, I'll grant.<br/><br/>However....that remains true of most miniatures and RPG publishers as well. Its a very rare company with an outward focus rather than an inward one. Much to the detriment of most of them. I would dare say even the bulk majority of TCG's are targted at the entrenched players as well, though only those that reach beyond them are the ones that become success.&lt;/p&gt;</blockquote>
But haven't the games that really stick out as successes been mostly accidental successes? D&amp;D, VtM, MtG?<br/><br/>I remember reading that Garfield was very much caught by surprise, and it certainly seems like VtM and D&amp;D might have caught their makers by surprise as well in terms of success.<br/><br/>I'm also not really sure that any of those game makers were really looking outside of the existent market initially. Rather, each of those games contained aspects that made it easy for them to break out unintentionally. In hindsight it's easy to see those aspects, but were the makers aware of them?                        </div>

                            Good point about the investment in MtG. I was actually thinking more about an old comment by Garfield that he never expected that anyone would own more than maybe 250 Magic cards or so, tops. ( I laugh whenever I think about that comment. I owned about 10X that, and I never considered myself a die-hard by any stretch).                        </div>

But haven't the games that really stick out as successes been mostly accidental successes? D&amp;D, VtM, MtG?<br/><br/>I think it might actually be the case that all major expansions of a hobby-gaming market have been largely accidental. They may have looked like successes to their publishers before publishing, but I really wonder if anyone has ever conceived and designed a product with the goal of growing their industry's base, and succeeded at it. Mostly when somebody tries to do this, it comes across as ham-fisted and suggests that if market research was done at all, it was done with a lot of bad preconceptions. (Put another way: even if you do see the wisdom in going out to the people you'd like to bring into your hobby and asking them questions, if you ask the <i>wrong</i> questions you'll still have worthless information.)<br/><br/>I've been wondering about this in the context of <a href="http://www.projecthorseshoe.com/ph06/ph06r5.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> (which I posted on OgreCave where it went over like a lead balloon) and of story-game design efforts like Clinton's Inuma. A few of us are thinking about games that will appeal to people clearly not served by mainstream gaming assumptions, but we are largely doing that thinking on our own; going and asking folks some good questions might be valuable. (I don't mean to single out Clinton's effort here, because I think his suppositions happen to be good ones, if in fact they are even suppositions at all. I'm making a more general point and it's difficult to avoid associating all the nuances of that point with my example, but it really is just an example.) <br/><br/>It's late and I'm not making sense. Good night, tip your waitresses, try the fish.                        </div>

I don't think it's accurate to say that anyone <i>expected</i> these products to be huge hits. VtM and MtG were certainly launched with <i>hopes</i> that they'd be successful, but I don't think either game's publisher knew exactly what the reaction would be; not based on Shannon's columns on RPG.net, at least.<br/><br/>As for D&amp;D, what I've read indicates that Gygax (especially) and Arneson obviously believed they had a product people would enjoy; they wouldn't have published it otherwise. According to ptgptb.org, though, initial reception wasn't that great, and it took a year to sell through the initial print run of 1000 sets.<br/><br/>I think that, like any great product, these games started with a cool idea that someone believed in. Rather than cashing in on a market, they created one.                        </div>

Back in the 70's, Jim Dunnigan ran ads for Strategy &amp; Tactics in science fiction magazines like Analog, and even in Scientific American. I think there's also been some advertising in history-buff magazines by wargames publishers over the years. It's interesting to note that Dunnigan's original advertising initiative was targeted at "smart people" (his words, IIRC), not history buffs per se, in spite of the fact that SPI mainly produced historical games. Nowadays, wargaming of the SPI variety (which lived on even though SPI went out of business in 1983) has shrunken, and so has Analog's subscriber list. Coincidence?<br/><br/>Also, back in the 70's, Avalon Hill and SPI wargames were sold in regular toy stores and hobby shops alongside Barbie and GI Joe, scale model kits, and Lionel trains. Games were a normal part of being a kid, and wargames benefitted from being stacked with Battleship and Monopoly, where kids could see them and "graduate" to them as they hit their teens. That's also where I saw my first RPGs for sale, including White Box D&amp;D, Boot Hill, Metamorphosis Alpha, and Traveller. Nowadays both RPGs and wargames are mainly found in "game boutique" type stores, while Monopoly and Candyland are at Toys 'R Us, Wal-mart, and Target.                        </div>

<br/>

24 out of 29 who have Game Mastered above, also play indie games.<br/>
13 out of 18 who have never GMed above, never play indie games.<br/>
The 5 above who have never GM but do play indie games, are also new players (playing 1 year or less).<br/>
12 out of 15 who play MMORPGS, have never GMed.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't polled this but I believe a huge portion of those who do GM also:<br/>
- tend to work, participate, or have interest in some sort of creative field (writing, acting, drawing).<br/>
- when not GMing, tend to play characters that have special powers that they can be creative with, such as magic users.<br/>
<br/>
This all loosely reminds me of what Robin Laws wrote here:<br/>

<div class="QuoteText">DUNGEONS AND OTHER UNSTRUCTURED ADVENTURES<br/>
Despite the inroads narrative-oriented games like Call of Cthulhu and Vampire have made over the years, most gamers still cut their teeth on plot-free adventures of exploration, action, and looting. The ultimate expression of this adventure type is the dungeon. Dungeons are great for starting GMs, because they donâ€™t have to worry about plot at all. The plot consists of the arbitrary order in which the PCs decide to knock down doors and beat up the monsters behind them.<br/>
<br/>
Although storyteller types find them utterly unsatisfying, your particular group may like them just fine. One of the big advantages of the unstructured adventure is that itâ€™s dead easy to create. Each area is a discrete and separate unit. You can add a new room to your dungeon complex at any time. You donâ€™t need to weave a complicated plot or worry about dispensing clues at the right rate. You donâ€™t have to play a bunch of different NPCs, keeping their motivations and funny voices straight. Your main concern lies in game balance, in making sure that the adversaries the PCs find behind the doors they bash down are neither too easy or too hard to vanquish, and that they treasures they guard are properly keyed to the charactersâ€™ current power level. Any rules set that supports this style of play makes these decisions easy for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your players like the dungeon-crawling style of play, let no one convince you that thereâ€™s anything wrong with it. It is probably still true that the majority of roleplayers active today prefer unstructured, exploratory adventures. Most roleplayers still play Dungeons and Dragons, and use the dungeon style of play it best supports.<br/>
<br/>
This style is popular because itâ€™s easy to run, and because it perfectly suits butt-kickers, power gamers, most specialists and casual types, and appeals reasonably well to tacticians. However, when storytellers and method actors first encounter plot and characterization, they experience an epiphany and drift off in search of games that better serve them.<br/>
<br/>
<b>A drawback of the unstructured style is that GMs get tired of running it sooner than players tire of playing it. Because the hundredth dungeon encounter you design is more or less like the tenth, the adventure creation process gets monotonous after a while. The ease of the dungeon style turns out to be a mixed blessing, too; many come to find it insufficiently challenging. GMs are disproportionately likely to be storytellers themselves, and want to introduce intricate plots, play weird NPCs, and show off their lovingly detailed worlds.</b></div>

I attended a "State of the RPG industry" seminar at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.iconsf.org/" rel="nofollow">I-Con 26</a> this weekend with Robin D. Laws, Patrick Kapera, Mike Pondsmith, and Luke Crane.<br/>
<br/>
Funny enough, this topic came up! And I mentioned my reference above in Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering to Robin Laws and he seemed to be in agreement. Although not everyone on the panel saw it that way. There was much debate whether the RPG populace is shrinking or fracturing (and possibly growing). The Forge was mentioned several times.<br/>
<br/>
My friends mocked me non stop because even though I've worked closely with Davie Bowie, The Rolling Stones, Iman, Sarah McLachlan, and many others... I was star struck and nervous to speak to Robin Laws! I kept saying, David Bowie may be your hero but Robin Laws is mine!<br/>
