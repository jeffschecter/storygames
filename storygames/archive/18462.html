The games inside could be great or they could be terrible; they could be "finished" or they could barely hang together; they could be so experimental or conceptual that they are impossible to play. <br/><br/>No matter what they are like, I love them all: I think they are amazing ways to (1) try out indie publishing, (2) connect on equal footing with other game designers, (3) show off your crazy ideas, (4) maybe get some feedback on something, (5) maybe send a project out into the wild that you'll never work on again, (6) maybe see if there's enough interest in something to keep pursuing it (even lower risk than Kickstarter!), etc. Whether people play them or not, whether it goes anywhere or not, I think they're great. Years later, they stand as a monument to a specific moment in your creative life and a record of the ideas you were experimenting with.<br/><br/>I don't think they are necessary at all; I don't think people should feel like they have to produce them; but I love the little glimpses they provide and the way they make possible the publishing (in print!) of games that may not be feasible in any other format. Selling 6 copies of the game you photocopied at Kinkos is a super boss feeling, and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>I suspect (though I don't know for sure) that Jason is upset about a particular moment in Forge indie games history (The Ashcan Front from GenCon 2007) and some of the ideological and publishing debates that happened around it. But hopefully he'll set me straight!<br/><br/>Jason, what's wrong with ashcans?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415746/#Comment_415746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T17:11:25+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  5:11PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not Jason, but will answer! The problem with ashcans is that you are commercializing your workflow. Like in your post, we need to define terms: game that you are done with and happen to be producing in a low-cost, lo-fi manner -- that is not what I'm talking about. In-progress, unfinished thing, no matter the publishing quality -- that is what I'm talking about. If you sell something that isn't done and isn't playable, that is problematic. I'm not going to go so far as to say wrong, because to each their own and I can see the artistic merit in it, plus it's an idea that's culminated in Kickstarter, which I think the jury's still out on. But, <em>for me</em>, it's unethical.<br/><br/>The outcomes you mention, Jay-Wall, are good ones and I think they can happen without money changing hands. If I were going to a convention today and had a game ready for playing, but not ready for publishing, I'd print up some copies and put them in people's hands to check out. If I had a game I knew I couldn't finish, I'd put it up for others to use and do what they want to with (this, I've done plenty.)<br/><br/>TL;DR: they make something about money that I don't think should be about money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415749/#Comment_415749" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T18:31:45+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  6:31PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Clinton">@Clinton</a> - I'm confused as to why you think an unfinished game, sold with the caveat that it's unfinished, is somehow unethical?

I agree with Clinton, selling half-finished stuff is not good no matter how clearly you mark it as half-finished. I am 130% pro lo-fi, DIY, short-run, infoshop madness. It is only the commercial angle that bothers me, for two reasons.<br/><br/>1. There's no evidence it is helpful, in the 2007 Ashcan Front way. Did the process help any of those games get finished? I could be wrong but I think not.<br/><br/>2. It plays on status in a really ugly way while simultaneously feeding the nerd completist/in-crowd impulse. Who wouldn't buy the latest cool mystery cult object from Paul Czege? I did! I think indulging in the sale of half-finished stuff hurts the community and maybe your reputation.  But that's just how I feel, I'm pretty sensitive and I have also been wrong before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415755/#Comment_415755" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T20:02:03+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  8:02PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 8:04PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it depends on what you're selling, and who you're selling to. I mean, if I'm a D&amp;D DM, and I buy (say) a location supplement, and 80 percent of it I never use in play, did I get ripped off? You don't really know until you know how much I liked the 20 percent I did use. Even if some of the stuff I didn't use was complete garbage, you just can't tell from the fact that what I bought contained that.<br/><br/>(It gets even crazier, did I get ripped off if I used 20 percent and hated it and thought it was stupid? If I thought it was okay but 100 percent of the other players hated it? How about if 51% of the other players hated it?)<br/><br/>Most people selling RPG material aren't selling games, they're selling creative tools for people to use in their (normally D&amp;D) games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre" title="Jerome_Larre"><img alt="Jerome_Larre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tengajdr.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/smallavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre">Jerome_Larre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415756/#Comment_415756" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T20:23:07+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  8:23PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 8:23PM by Jerome_Larre.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can anybody give a quick insight about what was the 2007 Ashcan Front ?<br/>Jonathan's first message makes me think I misunderstood it then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415757/#Comment_415757" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T20:36:46+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  8:36PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Can anybody give a quick insight about what was the 2007 Ashcan Front ?<br/>Jonathan's first message makes me think I misunderstood it then.</blockquote>\nYes, I'd like to know too.

I sold my game Poison'd as an ashcan at GenCon, and the feedback I got from its ashcan's players made a stronger finished game.<br/><br/>I still sell pre-release versions of my games, when I have a reason to. I made and sold a 25-copy "preview edition" of Apocalypse World, for instance. It was kind of gorgeous.<br/><br/>Most or all of the ashcans sold at the Ashcan Front were ethical. Everybody was careful to be clear that these were games in development, not finished games. Most or all of them included the promise of a discount on the final game, when it came to be. I personally bought most or all of the Ashcans on offer, and I don't regret it a bit.<br/><br/>The goal of the Ashcan Front was to be a solution to the problem of finding playtesters. The reasoning went that if someone invested a little cash in your game, knowing it was unfinished and still in development, they'd be more likely to invest time and effort giving it a try, and give you feedback.<br/><br/>It turns out that nope! That's not what happens.<br/><br/>You can see the exact effect today in some Kickstarters, when one funds beautifully with lots of buzz, delivers well, but then disappears from view because nobody plays the game once they have it. It turns out that a game that doesn't inspire people to play it doesn't inspire people to play it, even if they spent money on it. The way to find playtesters is harder than selling an ashcan, it's to design a game that people will be eager to play, even when it's still in development.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415762/#Comment_415762" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T21:13:51+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  9:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 9:15PM by Mcdaldno.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415763/#Comment_415763" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T23:41:35+00:00" title="June  8, 2013 11:41PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Creators commercialize their workflow all the time. If you bought Scrivener you bought into a commercialized workflow. The product works, but it's under development. Tinderbox sells its updates. So does Adobe. Artists sell their sketches. All but maybe one or two of the games done as an ashcan in the two years of the Ashcan Front was as complete and functional and as incomplete as an early release of Scrivener or Tinderbox or Photoshop.<br/><br/>Getting people interested enough in what you're doing to playtest your game is hard. You pretty much try anything and everything you can think of. You can have your game up for download online and promote it to the best of your ability and still not provoke any playtesting, or enough playtesting. When you've tapped out your inner circle and your wider circle, how do you find new people? Gen Con is expensive. But it's the biggest gaming convention in the western hemisphere. The dealer hall at Gen Con is expensive, but the vast majority of Gen Con attendees will pass within feet of you and maybe give you a little of their time if you set up shop there and you can catch their eye. You could spend years online fretting out a couple of potentially interested people a month via social media and it'll all add up to maybe a day's worth of the conversations you can have in the dealer hall at Gen Con with people passing by who are hungry for something new.<br/><br/>Except, it doesn't work. I'm not sure why. Danielle got no playtesting from her Kagematsu ashcan. The designers who participated in the Ashcan Front benefited from the relationships they made with others in the design community, and almost not at all from new relationships with the wider Gen Con attendees who bought their ashcans. The ones who completed their games would have done it anyway, with their existing circle of gamers, or connections they made in other ways, or the connections they made with others in the design community from participating in the booth made it possible for them to complete their games.<br/><br/>However, you can do things with physical objects that are inspiring to some people, things that just might tip them into playtesting your game. A letterpress cover like The Smoke Dream. A splatter painted cover. A hand stitched binding. Selling ashcans at Gen Con might not be a solution for wider playtesting, but even within your inner circle and wider circle people still have limited time. You'll do whatever it takes to capture their attention for your game. John Wick does YouTube videos. I don't think I'll be doing an ashcan for The Clay That Woke, but I'd absolutely do one again for a game in the right future circumstances.<br/><br/>Paul<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415769/#Comment_415769" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T01:23:54+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  1:23AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes an ashcan is necessary for the design process because the game has visual or tactile elements that need to be tested out. For example: the Finnish edition of <i>Zombie Cinema</i> was not quite an ashcan (that is, the game design was finished, and it was sold as a finished special edition), but it was a small run (100 copies), handcrafted, and basically a test run for the more ambitious 1000 copy English production run. The latter could not have happened without the prototyping and experience accomplished in producing the former. I could easily imagine myself doing the same thing again with a somewhat more unfinished game design, if the situation warranted it.<br/><br/>As for why ashcans are sold for money instead of distributed in other ways, I think that's a good question. As has been said, ashcan sales per se do not seem to engender motivation for the sort of creative partnership that a designer hopes for. Ashcans and similar drafts in other creative media are often not sold, but rather distributed on the basis of social networks and status games and such. The equivalent would be if I sent my new game's beta draft to Ron Edwards, Paul Czege and then down the list of my personally important game designer idols in the hopes of catching their attention and garnering some feedback and playtesting. There's a disadvantage in how closed that sort of process is, but then what use is an open process if nobody's interested in participating?<br/><br/>For myself, I suspect that selling ashcans is probably counter-productive for finding the right partners for your process, except if it's done in a large enough scale and high profile enough like my Finnish-language Zombie Cinema; that style works because the game gets in so many hands, gets reviewed and discussed as a finished game, so it produces the creative attention you need. However, for an ashcan any smaller than that it seems to me that you'd be better off producing just ten copies and choosing who to give one very carefully. Every copy you sell to somebody is a copy that goes into hands that feel not the slightest obligation to help you.<br/><br/>Then again, I think that the Ashcan Front had solid reasoning: I wouldn't be willing to pay for that booth if the other side of the equation (the interested playtester) didn't participate in the expenses in some manner. It'd just be way too expensive, unless my game absolutely couldn't be finished without doing it.<br/><br/>Regarding practical plans, I'm planning to produce about a dozen copies of an <i>Eleanor's Dream</i> ashcan once I finish the writing. These'll go to long-term Finnish (the game's in Finnish) acquaintances who've shown enduring interest in this sort of shit, and I'll ask first whether they're interested in taking a careful look and preferably playing the game. Very similar to how book publishers handle advance reader copies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415778/#Comment_415778" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T05:20:05+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  5:20AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2013 6:09AM by Graham.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Ashcan Front, for me, had two things about it. Firstly, a homemade aesthetic to printed games. Secondly, a commercial model of selling 80% finished games, so you could get feedback.<br/><br/>The first bit was great. It produced beautiful things.<br/><br/>The second bit, for me, wasn't. There was, I think, nothing <i>ethically</i> wrong with it. People knew what they were buying.<br/><br/>But it created a weird commercial incentive. For a while, there was much excitement around ashcans, and this tempted people to sell half-finished games under that umbrella. It was less work, it was popular and respected game designers were doing it: why wouldn't you do that?<br/><br/>It is hard to draw the line between what was okay and what wasn't. For me, Paul's Acts of Evil ashcan was a cool thing, a game which he'd come to a creative block with, so he produced a beautiful object to inspire others to help him finish with it. Eventually, he even gave anyone who had bought the ashcan permission to finish the game themselves. All cool, all ethical. But they weren't all like that.<br/><br/>You can see a similar thing happening with Kickstarters. They give people a bad incentive to sell half-finished games, provided they present it in an aesthetically pleasing way (i.e. with a nice video or a good logo).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415781/#Comment_415781" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T07:15:57+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  7:15AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2013 7:17AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to pick on you, Paul!

Thanks to all who are participating. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I'm generally a huge fan of ashcans because I think deadlines and products are great ways to move people to actually getting something out the door to players. I look at something like the Dungeon World red book, and I'm stunned by how much of the game's success hinged on getting the game into people's hands in a way that signaled that the game was worth the player's time. It's a totally different kind of thing than just putting up a game on a forum or a blog because the producer of the ashcan/early release took the time to produce a physical thing. And I think that's cool.<br/><br/>I also think that designers are probably bad at knowing what value people are really taking from their game (h/t <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley%29">@JDCorley)</a>. My first game, <i>The Play's The Thing</i>, totally falls into <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley%27s">@lumpley's</a> description of a successful Kickstarter that no one plays; it turned out that people wanted to own the game much more than they wanted to play the game. I think this is 50% because owning a Shakespearean RPG is cool, and 50% about the actual game play itself. But I've also had people email me to say that they've used some ideas or resources in the game in ways that I didn't expect. <br/><br/>But then... I'm sympathetic to <a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar%27s">@Jason_Morningstar's</a> point that ashcans can ultimately be about status. And that's some ugly stuff, where our community is less focused on producing playable games than we are on producing saleable products. While I wouldn't call that unethical, it's clearly not an optimal outcome. I hadn't thought about ashcans through the lens of status before.<br/><br/>I guess part of me worries here that this is really about design process, and I'm pretty loathe to make a lot of judgements on what other people do to bring games to fruition. Some people work on a game for 2 years, release the text for free, and put up a Kickstarter... others have an idea, print some ashcans to see if people are into it, and then self-publish a run of books if they get good feedback. I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling anyone how to put together a great game. (And maybe that the ashcans themselves might be the best outcome for the game, the best format for an idea that isn't actually going to go any further.)<br/><br/>Do others feel like ashcans aren't a legitimate part of the design process? Like they are a detour from finishing something of worth?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415784/#Comment_415784" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T08:09:01+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  8:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any designer can use any excuse to not finish something.

I don't see why paying someone $5 or $10 for a booklet full of really awesome ideas that you can use at the table or as food for thought for your own games is bad, even if you don't end up playing the game as-written. How many games do you own that you've never played exactly as written? Heck, D&amp;D4E is more unfinished than some of the ashcans I have. It needed a lot more work before it was released! (Skill challenges didn't make sense, the hp/damage stuff was all off, stunting was an afterthought, etc.). I don't consider any of the ashcans I own to be in a different category, especially if later versions of them don't exist. In many cases, I have the only version of this creative work that will ever be published, and that's pretty cool and valuable. If Jackson never finishes another version of The Smoke Dream, how sweet is the copy I have?

The ashcan didn't, at all. (I refuse to consider that my cover art on the ashcan was a liability.) It may be that the best way to get playtesting for an unfinished game is to publish it as if it's finished, get the feedback, apologize profusely, and quickly publish a revised version. But ouch.

In at least 2-3 different cases, it's take 1-2 years for games that I released as free beta PDFs to see regular external play, and in one case that play didn't start until I ran the game a couple of times at conventions (afterwards, those players went off and introduced it to others). If you want to publish your game a few months after you think it's "finished," that won't work, but if you're willing to wait, work on other games in the meantime, run your game semi-regularly at meetups, and be in it for the long-haul, I've found it works pretty well. Sometimes it might help to get an ashcan in the hands of someone who might organize a game, but it's no guarantee and you still have to wait months or years for people to get around to doing it. Everyone has a lot of games on their plate and it may be a while before they get to yours or find the right audience for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415805/#Comment_415805" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T12:14:05+00:00" title="June  9, 2013 12:14PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I think it's kind of inevitable that people are not going to be interested in playtesting stuff they paid for, though.

But I would say politics doesn't work like business. Politicians don't start out by trying to get you to buy lawn signs and bumper stickers. They start out by trying to get you to buy in to them. You get the sign and the stickers for free. Like it or not, I think people have a very different mindset about mercantile relationships, and no matter how much you tell them it isn't one, they probably won't believe you. No matter how nice your friendly local taqueria is, if they put up a sign saying they need some help moving boxes and prepping, you probably wouldn't feel much inclination to do it for free, even if you love the tacos. <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> is correct to observe that in other game businesses, playtesters usually get paid, not the other way around. I don't think there's any greater explanation than that capitalism is a thing that affects the way people think about stuff. And, of course, at GenCon, you don't even have the advantage of a community of people who interact with you regularly. It's nearly impossible to use social imposition on a stranger who's just paid you for something. How much money have you given to charity at the checkout counter at Walgreens?<br/><br/>If you want people to help you out of the goodness of their hearts and their love of your product, I think you have to start a different way. I mean, in a real sense, Kickstarter's whole purpose is to make a mercantile transaction feel like a charitable one. I can say from personal experience that some of the backers of Dog Eat Dog put in a lot of voluntary time and play that made the game and the Kickstarter more successful. They obviously didn't have to -- and many said they would and didn't -- but talking to them, and telling them that the power to make the game was in their hands instead of mine, made a difference. (Which is another thing politicians do -- give away ownership. You care the most about things you created yourself.) Maybe a suggested donation instead of a price. Maybe raise the money for the ashcans separately and give your limited copies away for free, in person, to people who seem most interested or most likely to try it. Anything to build an emotional connection, and a sense of personal involvement, before money comes anywhere near either of you.

Rather than claiming that stuff "isn't an ashcan," when that term is already in use and has a generally agreed meaning in a broader creative context, it seems like we're talking about specific practices related to ashcans that people object to.<br/><br/>Frex, here's wikipedia on ashcans: <i>In modern comics, ashcan editions may refer to promotional comics in the independent/self-publishing market. The term is sometimes synonymous with minicomics.</i> <br/><br/>And for minicomics: <i>A minicomic is a creator-published comic book, often photocopied and stapled or with a handmade binding... These are a common inexpensive way for those who want to make their own comics on a very small budget, with mostly informal means of distribution. A number of cartoonists have started this way and gone on to more traditional types of publishing, while other more established artists continue to produce minicomics on the side. Comparable with indie music, the phenomenon shares ideas about autonomy of the artist because of the DIY aspect.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415882/#Comment_415882" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T07:54:41+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  7:54AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon: Ashcan, with respect to role-playing games, has a particular history and meaning.

Yes, we like to hold ourselves and each other to high standards sometimes, but there's been plenty of games released commercially that had some issues that don't get the flack that ashcans do. It makes perfectionism and unreasonable playtesting expectations a bigger problem than they already are, which seems like ultimately it creates an even bigger divide between "established" indie designers and everyone else.<br/><br/>2) Publishing is increasingly not a big deal, whether in print (especially as a photocopied thing) or as a PDF or something else. The difference between whether something is formally finished or not is increasingly immaterial. At least out here in the PacNW, a lot of "unfinished" games by folks like John Harper (several versions of Danger Patrol, World of Dungeons, several versions of The Regiment, Ghost Lines), Ben Robbins (Kingdom, most recently), and myself (several versions of Geiger Counter, Metrofinal), and other folks get played regularly without anyone caring whether they "finished" or not. This isn't playtesting; it's just play. If I printed up some booklets of the latest version of Metrofinal to sell for $1-$5 at a meetup, nobody would bat an eye, and that's not because of my status or even because the games are playable and fun already, despite me not being satisfied with them. It's just not a big deal. You're paying for something that's enjoyable but ultimately disposable, like a beer.<br/><br/>Resisting this and insisting on a firm divide between "finished" and "unfinished" games seems like (1) resisting the tide of where publishing is going and (2) trying to establish a firm divide between creators and consumers, both of which I find to be really wrongheaded and bad for indie games in the long run. The good news, I guess, is that it doesn't matter what I think and people can do whatever they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415892/#Comment_415892" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T09:32:01+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  9:32AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2013 9:32AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno man, I think you are reading a lot into it.<br/><br/>I think the only hostility is toward asking people to pay for stuff that is half-done.

I thought it was supposed to be a signal that the project was at a dead end and that the designer hoped it would be prodded out of that state by the perturbations of fresh eyes on it.
