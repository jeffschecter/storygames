It's called Alteil, and it's a really frenetically-paced online TCG, a translation of the Japanese online TCG, that goes for the great, low price of free.  It's a very pretty game, with a really slick Flash-based interface and has card artwork done by some very big names in Anime, Manga, and Japanese cinema.  Happily, it also has a chat function imbedded in the gameplay, so you can IM with the people that you're fighting.  Works out nicely.  <br/><br/>So I'm bringing Alteil up for two reasons.  First, I've had fun playing the game so far and I figured I'd draw some attention to it over here and see if anyone else has played it or would like to.  If so, just head on over to www.alteil.com and sign up for a free doohickey.  You can find me there under the name Alcide if you're interested in a friendly game.  <br/><br/>Also, the interface is really, really fucking cool, guys!  It's slick, and pretty, and moves really fast.  I find myself wondering if an interface somewhat similar to this could be constructed for some great online gaming.  I'm not terribly skilled in the ways of Flash, but it doesn't seem like that far of a stretch.  Sure, you would have to construct the Flash interface on a game-by-game basis, but wouldn't it be cool to play a little Spirit of the Century online in a window that's SotC-branded, displays your character sheet in an active, animated way, and lets you click on your own aspects to invoke them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166277/#Comment_166277" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T21:38:43+00:00" title="August 30, 2008  9:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...hell, I'm taking Flash CS3 classes right now.<br/><br/>To do: Make a Spirit of the Century applet and an ANIMa console applet as homework assignments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166342/#Comment_166342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T14:14:33+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  2:14PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt Machell and I are working on a story-games browser-based interface, but it's not Flash (it's JavaScript), and it's not game-specific, deliberately. The aim is to give people online tools that equate to having dice, cards, character sheets and so forth and give you at least the affordances you get with the physical objects, inasmuch as that's possible virtually. That way you should be able to play most story-games, including new ones you're playtesting.<br/><br/>Clicking on character sheets to invoke attributes, roll dice etc. is part of the Phase 2 scope for the project. Initially we just want to get a die roller, chat client and possibly whiteboard up and running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
