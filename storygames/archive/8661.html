It was a lot of fun and in theory used the RuneQuest III system, but in reality the GM just narrated the outcome of events as they saw fit, loosely guided by a few skill checks. It struck me that the system the GM had chosen wasn\u2019t really supporting running the game he (and the players) wanted. My question is can anyone suggest a ruleset that might be more suitable?<br/>\n<br/>\nBriefly the details of the game are as follows. It was set in Atlantis which was an early Bronze Age culture. The PCs were members of a noble family and the plot focused on their struggles with a group of politically powerful librarian-priests who were trying to stop Atlantis sinking by conducting mass sacrifices of barbarians to the sea goddess.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was very much a traditional RPG, with all the scenes framed by the GM and little player authored content. However after the scene had reached a conflict the GM would call for a few appropriate skill checks and then narrate the outcome accordingly (with plenty of input from the players). For instance we had a fight scene where the fact that we would win and all survive was not in doubt, and the only question was how we acquitted ourselves. My character who was a distant relation trying to gain acceptance in the family failed his skill roll and injured the head of the family by mistake with a poorly aimed arrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM kept apologising for not running the game strictly by the rules and I think he would have been much more comfortable with a system that would have guided us through setting stakes, determining who won and then assigning rights to narrate the outcome. I discussed this with him and he agreed, however he asked me to suggest a better system, which I couldn\u2019t do. I thought of Primetime Adventures, which we had all played once before, but this didn\u2019t seem to fit given the heavily scripted plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be grateful if someone more knowledgeable could suggest a more suitable set of rules. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191633/#Comment_191633" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T07:47:41+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  7:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is perhaps a shot in the dark, but perhaps a minor hack of John Wyck's <a href="http://www.housesoftheblooded.net/" rel="nofollow">Houses of the Blooded</a> would work? It's a game where you play nobles in an Atlantis-style era. Your opponents tend to be other movers and shakers, but you cannot touch them directly - you have to do it through intrigue, deceit or the strict rules governing warfare. The resolution system seems to work for your purposes - if the player wins, s/he gets to decide if and how their character succeeds or fails, and if the GM wins they get to decide. It's intended for playing tragedies, which your game sounds like it is. Finally, it's Fate, which makes it rather easy to mess with if there are features you don't like or would like to see. Fate is traditional enough that most gamers should find it recognizable, but flexible enough to handle story rather well, IMHO.<br/><br/>Houses of the Blooded proper has a bunch of setting-specific rules governing marriage, seasons and so on, which may not be suitable for your game. Check out the preview PDF - it may be that all the rules you need are in there, and if not, the whole game is $5 as a PDF from IPR.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191634/#Comment_191634" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T07:56:43+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  7:56AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a cool set-up.

There are three characters involved.  The conflict for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is "do I impress character <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> with my knowledge of forensics?"

I am not familar with most of the systems mentioned but I will check them out. I do own a copy of The Shadow of Yesterday but I never got round to reading it.  Flicking through the rules now it looks like this might be the system I was after. Story Bones look interesting too and I think that I'll offer this as an alternative suggestion to the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to PTA, I agree that the conflict resolution mechanic would work great for the game we were playing. I just discounted it because the structure of the game was quite different, in that the plot of this game was fairly linear and there were no player requested scenes. Having said that as the group has played this before and liked it, it might be an easier sell than a system that is new to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answer to the question:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Russell, do you think the GM simply fell back on old habits when he didn't find the chosen system was delivering the desired results? How confident are you that you (and the other players) and he have the same vision for this game? "<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM said he chose to use Runequest III because he is very familar with it, rather than because it was suitable for the game he wanted to run. I think that he ignored the rules, and improvised his own as necessary to keep the plot moving at a fast pace. I think the players were fine with this. I certainly was. We have all gamed together for a number of years and so we know each other well. In our group normally the GM (we rotate this role) provides the vision for the game and the players trust the GM to ensure that it will be fun. And in this case it definitely was. The comment I made to him was just that he might find it helpful to use a game system that would give him support so he didn't have to wing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, thanks again for taking the time to give me some advice, I will pass it on to the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192114/#Comment_192114" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T11:35:46+00:00" title="February 11, 2009 11:35AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 11:38AM by Daniel H..">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the response, Russell.
