It is their duty to spread the word, get followers, establish Commandments for the group to follow, and make the god's will known and respected on Earth. They also establish the religion's sacraments (holy days, how to worship properly, etc.) and find a group of people to enlighten. They are caught between a modern, mostly agnostic and apathetic world and a god who hates taking "no" for an answer. In short, the religion will succeed or fail on the actions and words of the PC.<br/><br/>PCs can perform miracles, although the god has discretion and other PCs/NPCs can counter them. Miracles quite simply trump anything else in the game world, except a bigger, better miracle. Miracle Points can also be used to establish sacred areas of worship, reliquaries, and particular days ("holidays"), as well as improve the Heaven of that PC. (Here, I'm thinking something similar to Nobilis' Chancels). <br/><br/>PCs go on quests for their god, prevent the faithful from losing faith or schisms, and conspire to keep rival religions from succeeding past theirs. Alliances are tricky, but sometimes they can happen, especially against PC/NPC religions with a darker bent. I'm also thinking of establishing endgame conditions, where if one PC gets to a certain level, and no one can stop it, their religion takes all the faithful to Heaven, and the rest crash and burn in an apocalypse. <br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I'm tempted to go with FATE as a game engine. Aspects are nice and versatile, and I think spin is something I want for the game. Yes, I can borrow bits from The Last Exodus and Nobilis, but neither of their systems really do all I want. <br/><br/>Any advice or suggestions from this point? I can use all the help I can get.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125397/#Comment_125397" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T10:34:29+00:00" title="February  9, 2008 10:34AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, FATE's Aspects are exactly what I was thinking of when I was thinking of Commandments.

Having it be freeform presents a problem of too many opportunities all at once, but a little bit of structure will help people get a handle on them. <br/><br/>Should it be point-based, and the more points the miracle has, the more it can do? Somehow, I don't like that. On the other hand, I'm not sure the skill-based method of casting them works for me either. I'd like to keep a chance that the Miracle doesn't go off for some reason, whether the god has decided to veto it at the last minute or there's some interference. I'd like to allow for some variation, perhaps having the player decide in which type of Miracle their faith tends to specialize in, if they want to. <br/><br/>I think I'd like the Followers stat (however it works) to generate Miracle Points, and the Commandments stat to measure how effective the PC is at making the Miracles happen. If Commandments work as Aspects, then the player could spend Fate points to boost the chance at being effective if he's upholding a Commandment through bringing about the Miracle, while the GM (or even another player) could spend a Fate point to penalize if the Miracle is clearly contravening a Commandment. <br/><br/>See, in Last Exodus, the Miracles come in three stages: the Rite (a minor use of the Miracle type, but devastatingly effective if done cleverly,) Ritual (a medium level of the miracle which improves significantly on the Rite) and the Liturgy (full Speilbergian special effects version of the miracle). I want to keep this, with some modifications, but I'm not sure how to fuel it. <br/><br/>I'm tired, and I need sleep. I'll post more tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125464/#Comment_125464" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T22:10:56+00:00" title="February  9, 2008 10:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've loved the "first player to reach X in his stat ends the world" gimmick since I encountered it in Charnel Gods.

PvP is most definitely on the table, as I think it should be in this type of game. <br/><br/>And to be honest, I've considered using Sorcerer's mechanics for this type of game. From what I've gathered from working with Sorcerer, Humanity tends to have a nasty downward spiral. I'm not sure I want that. I *do* like the currency mechanics, and I think it would be easy to modify a chart for Miracles, extrapolating from the chart given in Sword and Sorcery. Plus, I could use the Demon section to create demons, angels, elementals, and so on. <br/><br/>Hmmm. Very tempting. Could anyone who has played Sorcerer extensively comment on this? It seems good on paper, and I'm familiar with the system, but I've only done one-shot games of it, and I'd like to hear what the system does over the long-term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125512/#Comment_125512" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T08:35:56+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  8:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I think about it, the more I'm becoming inclined to Sorcerer again.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me post some notes here, and see what you all think.<br/>\n<br/>\nCHARACTER CREATION<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of a sorcerer, you are creating a Holy Man/Woman (Prophet, Herald, Messiah, Zealot, Oracle/Soothsayer, Savior, Metatron, Potentate, Caliph, etc.) and a founder of a nascent religion. You are creating a hero, an exceptional individual who has to make tough, sometimes painful choices for yourself, your followers, and ultimately, the rest of the world. You are roleplaying Jesus Christ, Abraham, Mohammed, Moses, Mahatma Gandhi\u2026or, quite possibly, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, or Marshal Applewhite.  To reflect this, there are some differences in character creation from Sorcerer proper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI.\tWho/What do you worship? God? The Goddess? A pantheon? How did He/She/They introduce themselves to you? What was your life like before and after your Revelation? What is your name, sex, income bracket, and educational background? What big life experiences have you had? How do the Four Irreconcilable Truths, listed above, relate to your life?<br/>\n<br/>\nII.\tDivide 10 between your three basic scores: Passion (was Stamina), Inspiration (was Will), and Gnosis (was Lore).  There must be at least 1 in each score.<br/>\n<br/>\nIII.\tChoose appropriate Descriptors for these three scores. For each point of Gnosis, choose a Commandment you and your followers must adhere to in order to proclaim your faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nIV.\tSet Humanity equal to either Passion or Inspiration, whichever is higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nV.\tSet your Followers score equal to your Passion or Inspiration, whichever is lower.<br/>\n<br/>\nVI.\tChoose an appropriate Past (was Cover), Price, and a Telltale that gives others a clue that this character has been touched by a God or Goddess.<br/>\n<br/>\nVII.\tList details about people or places important to your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nVIII.\tRoleplay with the GM the first miracle your Prime Mover ever made at your request. This will determine your Communion score (was Binding Strength).<br/>\n<br/>\nIX.\tAsk yourself: is this character ready to take on the world? More importantly, are you eager to see what happens? Also, is your GM on the same page with you in regard to what the Commandments say about your God, and how you see the God acting in general? If yes, than continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nX.\tWrite your character\u2019s Kicker: what just happened that he or she cannot ignore, and for which there is no simple, obvious response?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGNOSIS is the replacement for Lore, and it\u2019s tricky to explain. Picture this: One day, out of the blue, the Architect of All Creation opened the top of your skull, squatted over you, and took a big, smelly info-dump into your brain. Then He put your skull back together, took off, and now that info-dump is boiling and bubbling in your brain, giving you visions, changing your view of the world, and somewhere in all of that confusion is your Deity\u2019s blueprints and instruction manual for what He wants you to accomplish during your time on earth. Yeah, it\u2019s like that. It\u2019s a true understanding of your Divinity\u2019s plan, unfiltered by your reason or emotion.<br/>\nFor each point of Gnosis, you have to come up with a Commandment for your religion. This is a big, potentially controversial \u201cThou must\u201d or Thou shall not\u201d that your Followers and you must adhere to. See the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments if you need some inspiration. They must in some way hinder or at least make you and your followers stand out as a test of faith and a show of devotion. They are the foundation for your God\u2019s plan on earth, and it is up to you to implement them as best as humanly possible.<br/>\nIf a character\u2019s Gnosis increases (Sorcerer, pp. 42-43), a new Commandment must be written. At this time, if a player finds a Commandment unworkable in play, he can opt to (with a successful Humanity roll) voluntarily decrease the character\u2019s Gnosis, and erase that Commandment. It can be rewritten when he increases his Gnosis.<br/>\nGnosis is, of course, the score to roll to see how well your Miracles come off. Miracles will be discussed in more depth later on. It is also the base score your character uses to square off against demons. The typical Descriptors are:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022\tAwakened:   \tGnosis of 1<br/>\n\u2022\tSoothsayer:  \tGnosis of 2-3<br/>\n\u2022\tProphet: \tGnosis of 3-4<br/>\n\u2022\tHerald/Savior:   Gnosis of 4+<br/>\n\u2022\tTruly Touched:   Gnosis of 4+; replaces Mad, requires a Price of -2<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHUMANITY is the heart and soul of any Sorceror game. It is the critical score to keep an eye on, and it is critical for everyone playing to understand exactly what it represents. In this game, since we are dealing with a complex subject, we must therefore have a complex, pluralized definition of Humanity to support that subject.<br/>\nThe first part of Humanity can be summed up in one word: Faith. Deep down, how much does your character trust and believe in her God(dess?), and how hard, really, does she work to make sure that people are sticking to the letter and more importantly the spirit of her religion\u2019s Commandments? Has she done enough to explain the Commandments and motivate her Followers? Has she given her all to convert the nonbelievers? When crises come up, be they moral or physical, does she trust that The One will protect her and look out for her and her Faithful? Is she ready and willing to do one of the most exhausting, frustrating jobs in all of Creation? Is she willing to die, or (harder still, sometimes) live day in and day out for her Lord and Master?<br/>\nBut there\u2019s the other side of the coin as well, and it\u2019s a doozy. It can best be described in one single word: Empathy. It\u2019s too easy to just sit back and scare your Flock with fire and brimstone. It\u2019s too easy to just sit there and quote Gospel at life\u2019s difficulties, hurling the Truth at believers and nonbelievers alike and hoping that they \u201cget it.\u201d A true Prophet, a real Holy Man always remembers what he went through the day he had his first Revelation. He is the human face of his God, and never forgets it. Can he support his Followers and give them meaningful council? Is he willing to take the worst of any catastrophe, to spare them? How much does he care about the nonbelievers?  How much can he relate to their concerns about the issues raised by his faith? How in touch is he with the outside world? How much is he willing to help out during a major crisis? How willing is he to touch lives, and be touched in return?<br/>\nAnd then there\u2019s the real challenge: giving both sides their due.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125516/#Comment_125516" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T08:48:18+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  8:48AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Important: In this supplement, Humanity takes the place of Inspiration for purposes of  wounded characters \u201cpulling themselves together\u201d after a nasty conflict in order to be effective. (Sorcerer, pp. 108-109) Inspiration, in this case, is confined to solving problems, navigating temptations, and people-management; Humanity supplants more earthly \u201creasons to live\u201d for the Zealot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a special note: If your character worships a truly transgressive God or Goddess, or has truly been "set apart,\u201d you may want to implement the Humanity Trading rules in Sorcerer &amp; Sword, p. 44. If you do so, your Followers score must be reset to equal your now-lower Humanity score, and you get the Flaw Pronounced Telltale in addition to your other Flaw. If you already have Pronounced Telltale, add the penalty to your existing Flaw. The \u201cHumanity maximum\u201d portion of those rules is not in keeping with this game, and is thus not allowed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125530/#Comment_125530" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T10:31:33+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 10:31AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To get back to the discussion, no matter which way I go, I could set this game up to be played two ways:<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n<li>The characters have gods independent of each other, and it's every religion for themselves.
