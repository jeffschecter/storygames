The other two are still important and I vacillate back and forth on what it most important to me in the moment.</div></blockquote>\nThis, along with my earlier comment about combinatorics and RISS, along with <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> 's very well-reasoned points about the need for a truly unifying principle, made a couple of things just click for me\u2014my own "mirror moment" if you will. :-)<br/><br/>Here's how I see RISS. (To an extent, I've kind of always viewed GNS this way, because of how Ben Lehman originally explained it to me, but it was very heretical there, whereas I <i>suspect</i> <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> will like this.)<br/><br/>You do have an organizing principle, the true goal of play or dare I say, Creative Agenda. This will be one of the four corners. You then can have some, all, or none of the other corners as well. But because there is always a hierarchy among the corners, you end up using the nPr formula, rather than nCr, so this leads to a <i>whole lot</i> of options:<br/><br/>Single-corner: 4 possibilities, clearly.<br/><br/>Two-corner: 12 possibilities (4P2). RI, RS1, RS2, IR, IS1, IS2, S1R, S1I, S1S2, S2R, S2I, S2S1. Here, the first one listed has primacy, but the game's design includes elements of the second thing as well. In the instance of a clash, the second thing will always "lose." So this is why, e.g., both RI and IR are included.<br/><br/>Three-corner: 24 possibilities.<br/><br/>Four-corner: also 24.<br/><br/>Total: 64. Much, much less constraining than a 3- or 4-fold model. Now, for my money, the 24 four-corner options are basically White Whales that we might chase but really aren't possible to achieve. As Sandra pointed out, Burning Wheel, one of the most technically and creatively ambitious games of all time, really only hits three of the corners. But that still leaves 40 options!<br/><br/>Sandra herself has alluded to this schema, by the way\u2014how do we resolve Hatred Parade clashes? By choosing which corner has primacy in a particular game. (It might not be at the design level, even, but rather for a particular outing the group deciding how to interpret a particular design.)<br/><br/>Now, I don't know that I can find examples for all 40 combinatorics options, but in subsequent posts I'll try to throw up the ones I can easily think of.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462867/#Comment_462867" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T18:05:26+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  6:05PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeepform games are IR. There is a pre-set list of scenes, and we improvise reactions within that structure. If the outcomes of, e.g., the character relationships are pre-determined as well, then you have RI. "The Mothers" is like this: the game only ends once a particular emotional trap has been sprung.<br/><br/>BW is IS2S1. Fundamentally, what we care about are the Beliefs. (Not the Instincts, by the way: you keep mixing those, Sandra! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> ) This is the character motivation stuff. But to work on those motivations in a reasonable way, you need good system mastery--S2. Finally, the way obstacles are set, the skill list, the lifepaths, and so on, all emphasize strict adherence to the verisimilitude of the setting.<br/><br/>By the way, I think it's the fact that BW is a 3-corner design is what makes it so hard to really grok for so many players / groups. It's not that it's mathematically so much more complicated than, say, Exalted. It's that it's thematically complex and requires multi-level engagement.<br/><br/>More later                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462869/#Comment_462869" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T18:10:36+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  6:10PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am liking this! \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462870/#Comment_462870" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T18:12:34+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  6:12PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right about B and I in BW, I think I've done it like five times over the last few months.

For those confused about the numbering, R I S S goes clockwise around the official poster for the RISS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP.)<br/>BW's take on Sb is very different from how I'd want to implement Sb. BW's resolution systems have a ring of truthiness to them but is that really enough for Sb? I'd need more experience with BW to tell. Rather, there was a Railsgnusto element at least to the Mouse Guard convention one-shot I played. Anyway, we can quibble over the details but BW is a coherent multi-corner design.<br/><br/>Matt, as much as I adore this, I want to state something early while this "hierarchical" combinatorics are in the bud. I might be wrong about the following statement but I want to run it by you:<br/><br/>When two of the corners get together, and by get together I mean inside the campaign designers, game designers, GM's or player's head, for the corners are antropomorphic abstract concepts rather than particular "player types", and the corners decide to cooperate, it's not always the case that e.g. Sandboxblorb says to Impronitfol "We can work together but I'm in charge in all cases". Rather, they'd go through the list of all the differences they have with each other that applies to that particular game, and go "OK, for this particular issue, we'll do it my way".<br/><br/>Now, usually, it's a lot easier if one of them <i>is</i> in charge for any unforseen circumstance. But a design can be coherent if say Sandboxblorb says to Railgnusto: "OK, for all of the clashes, I'm in charge, <i>except</i> for these particular three things, we'll do those your way."<br/><br/><br/>PS: even though I'm usually the most comfortable these days close to the Sandboxblorb corner, my <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21077/may-2017-currently-prepping" rel="nofollow">"Project Pancake" (Coursair Council)</a> is a multi-corner game.
