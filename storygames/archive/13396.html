Basically, you piece the dungeon together as you get deeper and deeper into it, in an attempt to destroy the entity of chaos and evil that lies at the heart of an ancient dwarven city. Most of the characters will undoubtedly end up dead.  There's probably Dark Fate-like things where some of the characters are secretly working for the evil entity.<br/><br/>But I need help brainstorming some of the chambers and areas that you descend through.<br/><br/>Basically, the format should be like this:<br/><br/>- Chamber Name<br/>- Original State<br/>- How to Draw It<br/>- Corrupted State<br/>- How to Draw the Corruption<br/>- Dangers<br/><br/>For example (though this particular one seems like an obstacle out of Drowning &amp; Falling):\n<blockquote><b>The Aqueducts</b><br/><i>The water in the underground has long been brackish and foul, so the dwarves brought in surface water through an ingenious series of chutes and catch-basins.</i><br/>-- Draw a vertical well-like shaft leading down into the city<br/>-- Break it off at several points and send smaller chutes to various rooms, where there are small catch-basins to hold any unused runoff.<br/>-- Create a large artificial pond or natural underground lake far below, for the well-shaft to dump surplus water.<br/><br/><i>Since the coming of chaos, shadowy sharks and rays make their homes in the basins and flooded rooms. The chutes themselves provide a treacherous but alternative entry point for explorers.</i><br/>-- Do as many of the following as you like:<br/>------- Flood one or more rooms containing catch-basins. If those rooms have not been drawn yet, mark the space and remember to flood them later.<br/>------- Create a breach in the main well-shaft and have water regularly pour out into nearby rooms at whatever rate you find most interesting.<br/>------- Draw shadowy aquatic menaces lurking in the flooded areas.<br/>------- Draw a leviathan, a great aquatic beast of some sort, in the pond or lake far below.<br/>------- Draw a couple places where parts of the chutes have collapsed, spilling water and forcing explorers into acrobatics or alternate routes.<br/><br/>When moving through the aqueducts and the flooded areas that have created, the chief dangers are (invoke as many as you like):<br/>-- Becoming disoriented and losing contact with your companions as you struggle through knee or chest-high water.<br/>-- Half-drowning yourself in an attempt to navigate the treacherous terrain<br/>-- Being pulled into underwater combat with an aquatic beast<br/>-- Being carried deeper into the city by the chutes or active currents<br/>-- Being seduced by the song of chaos which bubbles up from the depths below and can be heard most clearly underwater</blockquote>\nCan you help? What should be in a corrupted dwarven city? Cursed artifacts? Ghosts? Crazy machines?<br/><br/>I'm thinking there will also be loose instructions that, as the characters go deeper, the players are supposed to make the lower chambers worse, adding more corruptions and dangers to them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301919/#Comment_301919" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T11:15:45+00:00" title="November 23, 2010 11:15AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks like it'll be fun to play!<br/><br/><b>Neighborhood Forge</b><br/><i>Every dwarven neighborhood had a cooperative forge.

What I've got so far is <a href="http://plays-well.com/tartarusdeep.pdf" rel="nofollow">posted up here</a>, but it's not anywhere close to being playable yet.<br/><br/>To answer Jackson's question: like Geiger Counter, it started out as a simple hack and was progressing towards being a completely separate game, but I'm trying to rein it back in a bit and just make a more straightforward Mountain Witch / How to Host a Dungeon hack.  If that works in play, THEN maybe it's time to expand it into a separate game.  But I don't want to start down a long, long road without first making sure the fundamentals are cool.<br/><br/>So, basics:<br/>-- three types of locations: entrances, corridors, and rooms<br/>-- you generate several entrances first and then generate rooms and corridors and you descend down<br/>-- there is the above-ground level (the surface) and then 3 levels of dungeon below, with the lowest level being "the far depths" where the menace lives<br/>-- each level has several themes that are used to generate threats (like, the surface might start out as "graverobbers, ghosts, and carrion eaters")<br/>-- besting threats gives you treasure or enables you to search the room for "deadly secrets" (traps, hidden knowledge, secret passages, etc.)<br/>-- as you move to a lower level, you scratch off one or more themes and replace them with new themes<br/>-- so, as you approach the depths, the dungeon themes gradually become those of the menace itself<br/><br/>Other than that, it's pretty much going to be a GMless version of the Mountain Witch, at least right now, though I might simplify the "degree of success" and "wound" rules a bit to make them more intuitive and easier to grasp.  There will probably also be fixed characters, though I'm still deciding exactly who they are.<br/><br/>Sage, your thought about having different forces or secondary threats (mini-bosses!) is interesting and I'm trying to figure out how that could intersect with the rotating themes (the themes are basically my way of being able to foreshadow something that doesn't exist yet).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302844/#Comment_302844" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T12:12:59+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 12:12PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, your themes sound pretty close to what I was thinking of. Sounds like you might have "Death" and "Robbers" as themes for a level, yeah? So then you have zombies and Lara Croft and whatever, multiple forces that oppose both the PCs and each other.<br/><br/>The idea of themes and foreshadowing are a lot like the dungeon-on-the-fly rules in Dungeon World (not in the 'published' version, but available in the <a href="http://www.latorra.org/dungeon-world-svn/export/18/pdf/Dungeon-World.pdf" rel="nofollow">latest 'build' here</a>). When the GM needs to make a move and the players are exploring a dungeon, the GM can use a dungeon move to fill in the dungeon, doing things like changing the environment, introducing the presence of a faction or type of creature, using a threat from an established faction or creature, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302979/#Comment_302979" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T11:10:35+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 11:10AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I like some of those, Sage.

You should make your move when:<br/><br/>1. the characters attempt to obtain valuable treasure or lore without paying the full cost in blood and suffering (spring a trap, complicate matters, invoke the cost);<br/>2. the characters attempt to confront or out-maneuver threats and hardship that you have established when framing the current location (invoke as established);<br/>3. the characters are enjoying a lull in the action and the lull needs to be interrupted (spring a trap, complicated matters, separate them);<br/>4. the characters are turning on each other while still on the surface or in the first underground level (spring a trap, complicate matters, separate them).<br/><br/>In the lower levels, the characters should be left alone if they turn on each other, while you only invoke threats and hardship as previously established.

And then the players arrive and pick which cutthroat mercenaries and misanthropes have chosen to join Alberich for his final hurrah and last big attempt at fame and fortune.  Or, if it's "An Ill-Fated Escape from Hellmouth Purgatorium," who are the cutthroats and mercenaries attempting to escape with Alberich from whatever mess he's gotten himself into.<br/><br/>Then, the themes part works like this:<br/><br/>1. The overall expedition itself has a theme that's used to generate threats.  For Stormspire Peak it might be "storms" or "tremors" or "harpies."  For Hellmouth Purgatorium it might be "demons" or "flame" or "prison."  This theme can only be changed ONCE in the entire game, typically when the expedition has reached its final stages or some monumental change occurs.<br/><br/>2. Each "level" of the expedition (moving up, down, out, or in) has a theme that generates threats across that level.  For example, the base of Stormspire Peak might be filled with "temples," "scavengers," or "dust clouds."  When you move further on in the expedition, you switch this theme to a new one for the next stage.  You roll on an oracle for level themes, always rolling an extra one in advance, so the players know what the theme of the next level will be.<br/><br/>3. Each individual location in the expedition -- rooms, cooridoors, buildings, stretches of road, etc. -- has its own theme that's drawn on to generate threats at that particular place.  For example, the winding path that leads up to the very top of Stormspire Peak might have "vertigo" or "despair" or "poor footing."  When you move from one location to the next, you get a new theme for the new location. Like level themes, location themes are always known one location in advance, based on what the characters can see up ahead.<br/><br/>The one thing I haven't figured out yet is something I'm calling "threat bleeding" in my head, where a threat that was not fully dealt with in one location can "bleed across" the map to reappear or infect a later location.  This is basically a means of reincorperation of previous theats.  There may also be a way for unexplored areas to have their themes bleed back to an earlier location, but that foreshadowing part's less clear to me right now than the reincorperation part.  Maybe there are certain location themes that are specifically marked to bleed?  Like "Cursed Fountain: the dark water bleeds in a level theme from further below"?<br/><br/>Suggestions?

(The cursed fountain example makes it sound like something that the "board" dictates during set-up but your other explanation makes it sound like something that happens behind them -- so I'm not sure if I'm even grokking.)<br/><br/>Do themes retain any connection to their source tier?  I mean, is the theme associated with a room any different than the theme associated with the expedition at the moment in play when themes matter?  If they do, then when a threat bleeds, does the theme stay at the same level or does it climb to another level in order to bleed?  If the players ignore the vault with "cursed treasure" as a theme and whatever happens to make it bleed, does it become a level-theme or does it just migrate to another room?<br/><br/>In general terms, how do you define/measure threat completion to determine if a theme is eligible for bleeding?<br/><br/>Unrelated to threat-bleeding:<br/><br/>Might there be value in having character-themes that they drag into the adventure?  One more layer of replayability if I'm understanding the concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303471/#Comment_303471" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T14:43:20+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  2:43PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, my thought about "up-bleeding" was basically that you'd go ahead and generate a later theme (like, two levels down, maybe there's a room labelled "living darkness") and then have it manifest early, in the current location.  Maybe the living darkness is flowing out of the fountain and strangling the explorers.<br/><br/>The whole point of the bleeding is to break up the regular progression of threat types as you move through the dungeon, to have some things mixed up or come in orders that you don't expect, to allow for some foreshadowing and some "I thought we already got rid of that."  Basically to make things less predictable.<br/><br/>Right now I wasn't really thinking about upgrading threats due to bleeding, though that's an interesting idea.  In general, bleeding would mostly be a judgement call by the player framing the next location, I think.  Instead of introducing a new threat, you could bleed in a threat from somewhere else.  Or maybe when you rolled on the oracle to generate the next few locations, some of them would be specifically marked as allowing the framing player to bleed in old threats or foreshadow those from further up ahead.<br/><br/>With you last question... yeah, in many ways the Mountain Witch-style dark fates can almost be thought of as character-based themes.  Just like in Mountain Witch, if I've made a secret pact with the living darkness, I can probably just say: "Yeah, strangely, the darkness keeps its distance from me.  As I walk towards it with the torch, it retreats from me." Or are you thinking of something different and more theme-like than that?  (Also, should character-themes or dark fates bleed?  How would that even work?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303472/#Comment_303472" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T14:51:43+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  2:51PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is making me think about AW's MC's move "annouce future badness".

The three themes from the game-board that are in play at this moment are: Storms, Scavengers and Vertigo.  But on top of that, I'm playing Rex-Ray Pierre -- A great swordsman who couldn't have made it big without the magic sword he stole from the goblins.  His theme is "Goblin Bounty Hunters" or something and however it is decided what the problem is with getting across that damned Rope Bridge, Goblin Bounty Hunters are available under some circumstances.<br/><br/>So playing that same scenario with a different set of characters is likely to be even more different than it would have been without character themes.

I can think of a few different personal threats that could be interesting and would provide incentives for breaking up the group or at least making sure you're hanging with a subset of adventurers whose personal threats you feel like you can deal with.  For example, in addition to Rex-Rey's pursuers, you could have one character with a limp or wooden leg that slows down progress and makes acrobatics harder, one character who is actually a tiger-headed demon who crackles with dangerous chaos magicks, perhaps one character is a gnoll and will try to eat wounded companions, perhaps one character is haunted by ghosts, etc. It would be interesting, though, if perhaps characters' personal threats were only invoked in specific circumstances.  Maybe when you fail a roll the framing player can either assign a condition or invoke your personal threat?  That's not quite right, but something like that might work.

That's closer to what I was suggesting.<br/><br/>And maybe you can even combine both ideas.<br/><br/>As in "trade failure for thread token", and then later on having a "thread token" opens up more framing options (as the haunting thing). It can work the other way around too (you can give up a success for a "thread token", and later on you can also use said tokens for foreshadowing). And you <b>want</b> to spend those tokens before the final encounter with the menace, or else...<br/><br/>Maybe to have two different types of "thread tokens" (as in succeed - future badness; fail - foreshadowing). Although that might be too much needless complication.<br/><br/>Ooh! Another idea! You can use said tokens to include stuff (to your advantage) during <b>another player's</b> framing phase.
