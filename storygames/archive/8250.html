I suspect GMs being aggressive with Conditions without having aggressively taught Traits and Checks will be one of the more common rough patches in early campaigns (a trial mission with the pregens where they learn this lesson the hard way might be the easiest method)<br/>\n<br/>\nRead and reread the section on your season and use that to fill in details to make the mission come alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nStandard BW advice about not accepting lamo Beliefs and Instincts...Goals I think are of particular importance.  I think one of the hardest things for new players will be coming up with goals that are resolvable in the first session without having the experience to know what sort of goals are effective and sensible.  I think players learning the right scale and flexibility for goals will be a key learning hurdle.<br/>\n<br/>\nMG scripting is a more streamlined version of BW scripting...but the choices are really powerful.  Understanding the many ways to hose yourself with the scripting is key.  Set up an encounter where players can see the interaction of Weapons and abilities with the maneuvers and multiple teams with multiple mice on the teams so they can see how to bring each mouse's strength into the fray tactically.  The fight with the raven Thor ran us through was totally cool...full of "yes I'll script that, but no that's his action and he sucks at that, so I'll have to script this, but wait his weapon gives a bonus for that, so I'll do this other...but wait...Thor totally will expect the other for exactly those reasons...so i'm back to that, because he'd never expect that...AARGH"<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention to follow the mission rules.  Don't do any more than that.  Prep a couple of potential Twists just so you'll have them handy but otherwise follow the mission rules.  Know what the possible solutions are to each obstacle so if things start to lag you can just say..."make a scout roll to find the grain merchant" and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese the items I'm planning to hit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181597/#Comment_181597" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T15:46:05+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  3:46PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been greedily looking at the Mouse Guard RPG but won't be able to buy until I find some extra cash.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br>However...  <br><br>When I plan a new game/campaign I always try to distill the 3-5 main points (or set pieces) that I feel the setting NEEDS to get across the flavor of the setting to the players.  I make sure and hit all of those points hard in the first adventure.  I plan to be somewhat stereotypical of the setting's flavor in the first several sessions and try to emulate all the "set dressings" that I can with opening the game, cutting-scenes, chapter/title sequences, names of the books, "turning the comic page", etc...  Anything that brings across the feeling of why it's fun to read and look at the original fiction of the setting.<br><br>Once I have those things in mind I think...  What would be COOL but slightly different to do in the first game session compared to the fiction?<br>When I think of MG I immediately think of the battle with the weasel and the crab.  I also think of how the imagery reminds us of the size of the mice compared to things they interact with in the world.<br><br>So...  I'd brainstorm something interesting and cool to do battle with or at least show in the distance for fear of impending battles/challenges...  I'm thinking:  an old tom (cat),  a bat,  an owl,  a rattlesnake.... maybe reverse the "battle" atmosphere by having the Guard deal with things THEY (rather mice) usually look down on like worms, ants, termites, flies, spiders...  A SWARM of any of those would be creepy COOL!<br>Thinking of a cool PLACE to have these challenges  as  well as any props or challenges within this area.  Fighting a swarm of ants on their anthill or baby spiders coming out of their nest  or  larva/maggot eggs with newly hatched flies would be creepy/neat!<br><br>For "set pieces" I normally plan a "credit scene" opening to EACH game I run, and repeat it weekly prior to game (sorta like Star Wars' scroll openings)  complete with a chosen theme music appropriate for the setting and style of the campaign.  I'd immediately think of things from the Disney Musketeer movie, perhaps Robin Hood (Cosner's film) or even Gladiator.  If Secret of Nyhm has a soundtrack I'd find that to try...<br>I'd then look through rereading the comics and note any style of page or panel change to add to my "transition" style for opening new scenes....<br><br><br/>hope that helps a little.<br/>-kevin-                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181598/#Comment_181598" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T15:48:26+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  3:48PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H</cite>Have you read Mouse Guard, and do you know what your players enjoy generally, and also more specifically about the setting?</blockquote>\nI have read Mouse Guard, I have a decent idea of what my players enjoy.
