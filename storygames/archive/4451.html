When someone says something about the people they game with and refer to them as "my players" it makes me a little dizzy. It feels slightly creepy to me, the ownership and hierarchical structure it subtly implies.<br/><br/>I have a similar reaction when I hear my friends who are game designers talk about their fans. It seems to set up an artificial separation.<br/><br/>A disclaimer: I do not hate or disrespect people who use any of these terms.

I can't think of any games that use a term other than "player", but there are plenty that use terms other than GM.

If my game were done, published, and people were enjoying it I'd try things like "the people who play my game" or something.

I'm a "fan" of, say, Jared Sorensen. But, he's a friend of mine. We talk about stuff. Not like every day, but we chat it up sometimes. We've hung out. We had a good time. <br/><br/>Jared's a better designer than me. That's ok. But, he's into this hobby. He's on my level. We're peers, not because we're both designers (and other people are not). But, because we like each other, hang out, and have fun with each other in the hobby. <br/><br/>The minute Jared <i>expects</i> me to be his fan where he just assumes he's better than me, and I'm a consumer of his creations and thoughts (rather than a peer with whom we can dialogue, for example), a switch will go off in my brain that says "Ok, he's an asshole. I don't need him."<br/><br/>This exact scenario has gone down in my brain with real people. It's a big reason the Forge booth has been a hit, because it made people realize there wasn't some special fucking social club to "be" a designer. This presumption was and is prevalent among designers and publishers. They literally had jag-off secret pal hang-outs where they made fun of each other, and especially of consumers of their product.<br/><br/>Fuck. That. Shit.<br/><br/>There is no fucking "secret club" of designer-dom. It's a socially maladjusted construct created in people's heads. It's really, really, really stupid to think "Hey, I've <i>arrived</i> because So-and-so acknowledges me now, and I've lapped up his shit for years thinking he's more special than he really is."<br/><br/>There isn't one fucking So-and-so in this hobby who's that special. Not one. Every single member of the hobby is just a hobbyist. Some are in business, too. That makes them not special at all. Fuck 'em. <br/><br/>The level of social partitioning in this system is loathsome. The whole idea of "fandom" here is disgusting and insulting to regular people who either are in this hobby enjoying it (and sometimes not enjoying it) or to people who peer in from time to time, wanting to play, and quite rightly avoid it thinking "That's crazy."

Simon had it pegged from the first, and nobody's contradicted him. It's a paternal thing like a coach. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I'm a player, no, I don't say, "My players." It would be wierd to do so in that context, because, for whatever reason of historical usage, doing so would indicate heirarchical ownership... in this case. It just does. If, in fact, "my" is always ambiguous here, you'd find every player saying "My players." But, in fact, only GM's do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider that it would even be slightly odd to say "My group." Less so, but people are as like to say, "The group I play with. Yeah, even if it's grammatically incorrect, it's what people say. If you want to be grammatically correct, you'd say, "The group of players with whom I play." But people shortcut that because they want something shorter, and the grammatically correct "My group" just seems wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nJustin... no. You would't say "My setter did X..." unless you were the coach. As a player you'd say, "Our setter." Or, perhaps if you don't want to indicate possession, you'd say, "The Setter." <br/>\n<br/>\nSee, there's this other possessive pronoun that indicates group onwership. Even of a group. "Our Group." So, tell me Justin... why don't you use "Our Players?" If you're not trying to imply ownership of the group in some way, why aren't you using the pronoun that indicates that everybody owns the game? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, all that said... I'm not a sensitive type. I understand the argument that subtext like this in language can be informative and theoretically damaging. I'm of the opinion, however, that two things are true:<br/>\nA) We're capable of understanding the accurate truth about something, even if the language used is lazy or inaccurate. <br/>\nB) I don't know that you can change these habits, and to the extent that it is possible to change them, I'm not sure that it will change the underlying paradigms that you're seeking to do away with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not "anti-PC"... if you want to try to get the language use to change, be my guest. I just don't agree that people who are using the language in this way are trying to oppress anyone. At worst it's accidental. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of fan, while I agree with Matt that the behavior he's indicating exists here and there, I'd say that most RPG folks, "Industry," "Indie," or otherwise, tend to be humble folks. Moreover... can somebody point me to somebody actually saying, "My fans?" I'm sure that somebody can provide me a link to a quote, but that'll be the exception that proves the rule that people don't say it, generally. I mean, I'm certainly not seeing the phenomenon. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, you're right in your deconstruction of the subtext, Rob, but I think you're over-reacting, frankly. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100771/#Comment_100771" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T10:54:06+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 10:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No argument with you Mike on the general widespread-ed-ness (or lack of) of this thing.

At worst, the "my" <i>reinforces</i> the paternalism inherent to "coach". Let's take some different examples: (1) Me: "My sisters went to the mall"; Sister: "My brother stayed home." (2) Me, Garbage Truck Driver: "My garbage picker-uppers were slow as molasses today"; Garbage Picker-Upper: "My driver was like Speed Racer today".

If I were speaking with those in my group around, I'd say "our group." If I was talking about the group I'm in and someone else's group I might say "my group" as an associative method.<br/><br/>Again to make it clear I don't think people who do say this are nasty or evil. I get that for many people it's associative rather than a claiming of dominion. It just usually doesn't feel that way to me. For example when I twinge it's usually hearing a GM talk about the other players in his group, and the tone of it is usually possessive. For example, had Don said of our game this week, "On Monday, my players played a bunch of elves with twisted familial relationships," would feel weird to me whereas, "On Monday, our group played . . ." would not. "My group" probably would produce little--if any--twinge. Maybe it's a combination of "my" and "players" that makes it ownershippy and weird to me.<br/><br/>Though I'm less vehement, obviously I agree with Matt Snyder on this, of whom I am a fa--um, I mean--a friend.

It's like the racism thing... you have to have prejudice and power, not just prejudice. The point in this case is that saying "My GM" can't imply a power relationship because whoever heard of some player having power over their GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a player on a volleyball team can and would say, "My coach" and not be indicating a heirarchical relationship. Same with Tony's example. How could he have some hierarchy over friends (which implies peer relationship)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, you're ignoring the facts. No player says, "My players" refering to thier group. No, they don't say "Our players," either, I told you what they actually say, "The group I play with." Or "The Group I'm in." But the point is that you don't say that, you say "My Group" and, in this context, we know you're the GM. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you deny that? If I say, "So, in my group we play HQ" wouldn't you assume that I was the GM? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, one doesn't have to, and one might not in all cases. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as Rob said, it was a "slightly creepy" thing.

To unpack why I think that feels more natural, I think it's to go with being in a group that has many GMs, not just one.  (And we play some GM-less games too.)  I wonder if that element of my gaming experience that leads me to naturally go to "our."  Perhaps your sense of being irked, Robert, comes from how your group experience or something similar?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100797/#Comment_100797" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T11:35:44+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 11:35AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobody is implying that you do have more power, Justin. But you could. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, it's like the N word. White folks seem baffled as to why black folks can say it, but when they do, it's considered wrong. Even if the person saying it holds no malice. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have to explain why this is? Only the White person might intend malice, and the black person would then have to expend energy on discerning if that was the case. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a player says, "My GM" they're implying that they exist in a structure where one of two things must be true:<br/>\n1) The player is subordinate to the GM, or<br/>\n2) The player is an equal to the player.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of which is controversial, really. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a GM says, "My players" (since, again, no non-GM says this), one of two things must be true:<br/>\n1) The GM is the equal of the players, or<br/>\n2) The GM is indicating his heirarchical ownership of the players. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now Rob has to worry about whether or not the GM in question is oppressing his playas. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas, if you said, "Our players" or some equivalent, then he wouldn't worry. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in fact there are some ttheoretical third cases. Like when somebody says, "My GM" and they actually mean that they have heirarchical control over their GM. I can't think of a case like this, but it's just possible that there are groups where the GM is terribly limited in power, and the players dominate him. I'm sure that Malcolm would like to imagine that indy players are like this a lot, actually. But I've never actually seen it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the point is, Rob's not going to worry about that potential case. Any more than anyone would worry about a Black man discriminating against a White man when using certain language (though it's certainly possible, and probably happens every day). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the price you pay for being from that class of people who have power... you're under suspicion. Yeah, GM's I'm looking at you!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, wait, that's me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, actually... I'm really not so much against heirarchy. I say "My Game" and when I say that, I mean that I have some sense of ownership of the game. Because, frankly, this isn't about black and white people, but about players. Further, I'm a pretty enlightened dictator, I feel. As, probably, are most GMs who are saying "My Game," and, unlike wimpy Justin, actually mean that they own the game in a substantive way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean... the GM role is different. If, in fact, the players have decided to play in my game, and do so understanding (perhaps even demanding), that I control the game in ways that they aren't interested in controlling the game, then, in fact, I have no problem saying that it's "My game" with "My players." I don't think I do often, but I would without reservations. <br/>\n<br/>\nI often say that I "run the game." That could be seen as somewhat possessive. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis all came up a while back with regards to my HQ game online, where players were sorta threatening to play without me. They're certainly capable of doing so, and have done so in fact, with my permission. But there was a point at which my feelings of ownership were such that I said that while it was alright for us as a group to play without any player being present without their permission, it was not alright for us to play without me, without my permission. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've put in more work, I've been the one constant in the game, and I demand special privileges, as such. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... yeah. I'm OK with most "ownership" of games. Yes, there are cases where this indicates something abusive going on. But far from in all cases. So I'm even less concerned when somebody says, "My Game." Despite understanding that it means a heirarchical control of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100801/#Comment_100801" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T11:40:34+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 11:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another one for you:  "My playtesters"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

If it helps, I think where we're going to find the breakdown is in the definition of "power". The GM and players have different duties in the context of, say, D&amp;D. I think that inferring greater power from this different set of duties is a mistake. Certainly when we try to translate that perceived power imbalance to issues of hierarchy or paternalism. "Power" in what way? Getting to pick what monsters the PCs face? Making a final determination on situational modifiers?<br/><br/>Seriously, let's talk D&amp;D since I expect that's going to be a good common ground.

Directors often use "my actors" even though directors are rarely around when a production is going, and sometimes cast by another member of the theatre, and often take their turn as actors themselves, or a member of the crew.<br/><br/>Instead of actually having the hierarchy as an automatic part of the definition, clearly we know it's not since there are many cases where "my" is just fine, I think this aversion to the phrase "my players" has more to do with a discomfort on being seen as the sterotypical GM wielding power over the players, and extends to other people who might be playing that way as well, based on their use of language.  That same idea matches very well with "my fans".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100864/#Comment_100864" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T13:53:58+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  1:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not "automatic" Alvin, as I keep saying, it's suspected. <br/>\n<br/>\nJustin, you give some of the tools in question, yes. Much of it comes down to text that indicates that the "GM is the final arbiter" of things. I'm pretty sure that's in one or more editions of D&amp;D. For reference, I'm most familiar with 1ED D&amp;D. Note that I find that even where later editions may vary textually on things like this, people playing D&amp;D from edition to edition tend to adopt these rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of GM as "Final Arbiter" is pretty ubiquitous in play. Whether or not texts support it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, yes, even in terms of things like what monsters are encountered. The absurd example people give is, "You're character is hit by a massive bolt of lightning from the sky, and dies." This would actually be practicable in many games. But a less absurd example is, "You're first level character comes across a massive ancient red dragon [rolls], it hits with it's breath weapon [rolls again], and your character takes 24 points of damage. He's dead." <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the DM actually has tons of control over the tactical outcomes. Complete control, if he wants to take it. Including, interestingly, the oft used power of fudging (promoted by use of GM's screens), which allows them to keep players alive, even when the rules would otherwise kill the players. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo the players have any such abilties? When a player fudges, it's "cheating." <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all to say nothing of plot. Do the players get to decide in most traditional play where their characters are going next? If the DM makes up a dungeon, and the players don't think that their characters would go... do we end up going somewhere else, or to the dungeon? The DM can offer a seeming choice, but usually it's Hobson's Choice. You can go do X, which is the fun thing that I've prepared, or you can do nothing. The players are not at all empowered by the method of play to help create the direction of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can go on and on. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all because these game systems, and the traditions that have developed from them in actual play, have made the assumption that the GM is there to provide the entertainment, and, thus, must be empowerd to do so. So they are. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's a fine way to play. Again, there's nothing wrong, a priori, with having the DM have more power than the other players. As I've admitted, I still mostly play that way, and certainly played that way for 25 years. All fun and functional. It's a good way to divide up power for some sorts of play. Lately I give a lot more power to my players, but that's because I've found other ways to play. They still don't have as much power as I have, I don't think, but it's closer to parity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of the GM having most of the power, in fact, can be seen by the results of what happens when he does abuse it. What we refer to as Abused Player Syndrome. This phenomenon is caused by the GM using their authority to take away all player agency from a game. Most often seen as railroading. The classic player response is to resort to the one area of authority they have left, which is their character, and to have their character refuse to engage with anything that the GM throws out. Fearing that the GM will take any act as a willingness to have the character be played by the GM. This largely, again, boils down to play having broken down to the social level, and the player is simply disengaging as a way to show their disagreement with how the game is run (unfortunately this can become habit, and this behavior can show up in games where the GM is not using their power to take away player agency). <br/>\n<br/>\nHow does this phenomenon occur if, in fact, the GM isn't given more power than the players? If, in fact, these things are equal, and this is just the case of nasty GMs, then where are all of the GMs who have been abused by nasty players? Sure, abuse ofr GMs happens on the social level, but not at the play level. Because players have no power to abuse the GM, play only gives them authority over their own characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis power split developed, I believe, in response to players who are abusive on the social level. The games give the GM the power to decide things in play, so that they can attempt to use carrots and sticks to bring unruly players into line. This doesn't actually work, but it was the method that designers put into RPGs to try to combat this phenomeon (when, in fact, the actual phenomenon was often caused by Creative Agenda differences in many cases, something that can be controlled once it's known). <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, any claim like "Well, sure, but it can happen the other way around, some groups give more power to characters" doesn't contradict any of this. "Some Groups" are not "most groups" (I'd actually claim "the vast majority of groups" but I can't back it up with data), and the burden here is not to prove that everybody plays this way. Only that it's the most common thing, enough so that worrying about the power split (and it's potential for abuse), is reasonable. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100878/#Comment_100878" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T14:26:51+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  2:26PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, it seems clear (to me anyway) especially from reading Mike's long example based on D&amp;D, that the reason everyone is carrying this belief that the phrase "My players" carries a hierarchical meaning is really because of the "players" part and not the "my" part.  Everyone is assuming that players are weak and the GM is strong.  As several people have pointed out already "my" does not imply hierarchy by itself.  "My mother" "my brothers" "my friends" "my boss."  None of these examples carry the meaning that the person who is saying them is in a position of power.  Therefore, the "problem" with the phrase "my players" lies in the connotations people have regarding the word "player."  That is what needs (possibly) to be addressed.  Why do people feel this way about "player?"  Are those feelings justified?  If so, how can this "problem" be fixed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100879/#Comment_100879" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T14:28:21+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  2:28PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            incidentally, the reason I say "My players" is because saying, "My friends with whom I game and who always are players while I am always the GM" is way way way too awkward.

We like talking to each other about things we share an interest in and don't want to talk to people who buy our stuff at every moment we go to conventions. This is not a big deal and it's no different from people in any job. The fact that we share a bunch of procedural knowledge in common moves things along. If I'm in a room with Robin Laws and Ed Greenwood (as I was earlier this year) we don't have to talk about the workflow used in editing and development, for instance. It's about as "special" as working in any job -- no more, no less. Bitching about gamers is about as significant as bitching about customers when you work at 7-11. In the context of the job, you may tire of the same problems and eccentricities coming up again and again, but do you really think that the average 7-11 employee believes that everyone who doesn't work there is some kind of peon? It's ludicrous.<br/><br/>Basically, you're taking some people to task for wanting to have the odd drink without being regaled with a "Let me tell you about my character." Or on the extreme end, there's the RPGNet thread where Phil Brucato and Mark Rein-Hagen are accused of ur-fascism. There's a point where one doesn't want to bother with the nth explanation of how things get done in our corner of the hobby, especially when you suspect that the person you're talking to won't believe you anyway. One of the reasons I redlined the Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries was to show that process in part instead of proffering the nth explanation once again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100890/#Comment_100890" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T15:03:39+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  3:03PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2007 3:04PM by James McMurray.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>The only thing I can think, Tony, is that it is the paternalism it suggests.

Schoolkids say "my classmates" because there's a clearer term.  Actors, well, I agree with your interpretation too, personally. But my girlfriend, who is an actor, does not have that implied interpretation. For her, there is no implied heirarchy. I'm going to assume that its because she's been involved in theater for over 10 years, and I haven't, which is the reason for the difference in interpretation.<br/><br/>Players, like actors, but unlike teammaters, or coworkers, or friends, can have a built in heirarchy, but the usage is uncommon, and it really depends on your experiences.  It seems like the discussion is circling around the same point because of that. Some are cool with it, others are not, some are looking at both sides from the fence.  Player, especially 6 or 7 years into the indie revolution, isn't holding up to its traditional meaning, and not just because the games are breaking down the walls, but society and culture are changing the way we play and who we play with.  Maybe you and/or Robert are using language to get away from that tradition.  Maybe I'm stuck in my ways of language.  There's probably a dozen other possibilities, if not more, and the purpose of the examples isn't to judge or suss out the reason.  The point is, the meaning of "player" isn't clear anymore (which Mike touches upon, or perhaps hits a home run on and I'm too dense to see it) and we might have slightly minute differences in what player means, even if only connation and based on personal experiences and not a modification to a dictionary definition.  When the meaning of a word isn't clear, then you can bet implications of its usage are going to be muddled as well.<br/><br/>I can add another reason to the list of "why I wish there was a term that meant all players of a game, GM included".  Like co-players, or gamemates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100922/#Comment_100922" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T19:20:13+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  7:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Alvin.

So I wonder if some of the disconnects in this conversation might be because the terms have less to do with immediate relationships around a game, and more to do with the kinds of self-positioning (I almost said posturing) GMs sometimes do when they're talking about their games to other audiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100962/#Comment_100962" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T01:41:21+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  1:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think John Harper's words in all of this have been the most concise, straightforward and agreeable.<br/><br/><br/>Robert, to answer your question: I feel that "my players" resonates as possessive and somewhat condescending. It's also not my natural language choice. I use the phrase "we" if context will explain the rest, and "my gaming group" if that context doesn't yet exist.<br/><br/>Tonight we were going to play Spirit of the Century, but JB didn't feel he'd prepped enough, as the GM. So instead I ran some impromptu D&amp;D. Later on, I was talking to someone who asked how the game was. I said, "It was good, but we didn't end up playing our regular game, because JB didn't feel prepared to run it. Instead, we played D&amp;D."<br/><br/>It didn't occur to me to mention that I was the GM, because what does this outside person care who was GMing the game?<br/><br/>The only time when I really talk about who was GMing is when I'm writing up Actual Play or play-related advice. And then, I never naturally use phrases like "we", "our group", "my players", or the like. I mostly make "I" statements, like "So, I'm GMing this game of X, and I'm struggling with getting players involved in Y."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100987/#Comment_100987" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T05:47:00+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  5:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a good term that means "everyone who participates in the game, players and GMs" it's participants. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's accurate, and it's a non-jargon use of the term.

And, by extension, saying "my players" in a hierarchical sense is appropriate. Alternatively -- my view -- there is no hierarchical difference between GMs and players. Accordingly, saying "my players" doesn't imply anything because there's no there there.<br/><br/>I don't think the unparallel rules require one to conclude a disparity in power and certainly not a difference in the hierarchy. I see where people come from on this, but I think it's illusory. (And a subject for a different thread perhaps.)<br/><br/>For Bullseye, one of my primary design goals is superlative attention to terminology. I'm using "participants" in exactly that way for exactly that purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101014/#Comment_101014" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T08:11:41+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  8:11AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, then you agree, for all practical purposes.

Someone comes up with the idea that "hey, we should play a game together," calls his friends, plans a space, and whatnot. That person may not be the GM, but is the game host. If, say, someone couldn't make a game, this is the person they would call. They are primarily responsible for organization.<br/><br/>Anyway, that person is usually the GM, and in that case, "my players" makes total sense.

                       So, okay.. Obviously it's not so much the hierarchy that is thought of as bad by people. It's hierarchy among people who are supposed to be equals, friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I use "my group" to refer to the group I play with regardless of whether or not I'm the GM, but have only used players to refer to players *specifically* taking part in a game I'm running. My last long-running group, I shared the GMing duties with Lxndr. I only referred to "my players" in context of the game I was running, and "the other players" in games Lx was running. Even though Lx was as frequently the GM, I'm pretty sure I've referred to him as "one of my players" in describing things he'd done in game to people who didn't know him. It does imply a small amount of ownership.. But I imply ownership with "My friends" and such as well. They may be your friends too, but they're still *mine*. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobert, does it give you any amount of squick-factor if I refer to "my crew", speaking of the vehicle crew that I'm part of in the army? There is a hierarchy, for certain. When I refer to my driver, or my fire-support station operator, there is both ownership and a definite implied hierarchy. I'm above them, some might say better than. Does this feel the same? <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect it doesn't. If it does, then maybe the rest of what I'm going to say means nothing. In the context of my crew, the hierarchy is assumed to be desirable. In the context of my players or my group, they are theoretically my peers and equals, so implying hierarchy in this case is where it seems off. There shouldn't be a hierarchy among friends, peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's where it's just a matter of opinion.. In your typical GM-driven game, the GM has more power and more responsibility, granted by the game text, and more importantly granted by his friends. So there is a hierarchy within the limited context of that group during the times they're playing that game. In those circumstances, implying ownership and hierarchy is accurate and acceptable. In non-GM-centric games, that sort of terminology would be less accurate, and might imply some of the greasiness that people here are suspecting in the phrasing, and hence may be symptomatic of a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101705/#Comment_101705" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T14:51:13+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  2:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Robert, does it give you any amount of squick-factor if I refer to "my crew", speaking of the vehicle crew that I'm part of in the army?

It isn't to trivialize your feelings on the topic, but perhaps to understand their roots, which would help in identifying why certain people might agree with your feelings, and others might not. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour distaste for "fans" may have a different cause, though. Do you feel equally about a person self-identifying themselves as a fan of a designer (rather than just their games) as about a designer speaking of their fans?
