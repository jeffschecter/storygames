Recently I uncovered it and thought I would post it for people to...you know..whatever people do with games. I haven't figured out how to post word files so here is a rough copy/paste of its contents. Enjoy. <br/><br/>House of Licorish Lords<br/>Sex Move<br/>When you have sex, you learn a deep secret about your lover. This need never have been mentioned before in the game. <br/>Darkest Self<br/>None would suspect the depravity that dwells deep within your heart. What is learned can never be unlearned and what is known to some shall henceforth be known to all. Just as you gather other\u2019s secrets in your hands you scatter them to the winds. When in darkest self, the lords will abuse the trust of their friends and sew pain for future reaping.  <br/>Advancement<br/>  Take another Licorice move.<br/>\x81\uf081Take another Liquorish move.<br/>\x81\uf081Take a move from another Skin.<br/>\x81\uf081Take a move from another Skin.<br/>\x81\uf081You have A Seat in Parliament.<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Sweet (max 3).<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Sour (max 3).<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Smokey (max 3).<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Bitter (max 3).<br/><br/>Playing The Liquorish Lord<br/>Powerful, vengeful, conflicted, secretive. The liquorish lord is a trader, a trader in secrets. At their best they act as close confidants that can heal hurts by offering understanding and lightening the load of one\u2019s conscience. At their worst they destroy enemies not with a sword, but with their cruel words, true or otherwise.  <br/>Name<br/><br/>Name<br/>Choose a name:<br/>Ajani, Ariel, Caleb, Dominic, Gabriel, Jackson, Morgan, Raidah, Susie, Victoria<br/>A common name, a strong-sounding name, a name implying victory, a name implying tribulation<br/>Look<br/>Circle one in each list:<br/>Wiry, honest, rich, bitter, friendly, anxious<br/>dark eyes, disquieting eyes, lying eyes, wounded eyes, jade eyes<br/>Origin<br/>Circle one:<br/>Exiled, wealthy, friend of the poor, duelist, abandoned <br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>Name:<br/>Stats<br/>Add 1 to one of these:<br/>Sweet 1, Sour -1, Smokey 1, Bitter -1 <br/>\uf06d<br/>Carry Forward<br/>Conditions:<br/>Notes:<br/>Harm :<br/><br/>Experience Points:<br/>\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf06dadvance <br/><br/>Your Backstory<br/>You have two friends who already told you a personal secret, take 1 string against them<br/>There\u2019s someone who you have treated poorly, Mc picks and gives them a string against you<br/>Strings<br/>Liquorish Moves<br/>Choose two:<br/>\uf06dSpun Finery<br/>The Lords of Liquorish know that knowledge is wealth\u2026literally. You can spin secrets into high quality items to wear and carry about your person. Should you give the item away, that person will learn the secret it\u2019s made of. <br/>\uf06dSoft Spoken <br/>Whenever you use your secrets to help a friend, mark xp. <br/>\uf06dDualist<br/>When fighting in a one on one duel with a willing opponent, take 1 forward. <br/>\uf06dLies, Damn Lies<br/>You may spend two strings on someone to plant a falsehood so subtly they think they alone discovered it. <br/>\uf06dChocolate Coins <br/>You are very wealthy and want for little even when roughing it. Automatically succeed to hold steady against nature. <br/>\uf06dTake a Bow<br/>When you take credit for something you didn\u2019t do, mark xp. <br/>\uf06dLiquorish Twist<br/>You may unravel a secret you\u2019ve collected undoing it in the minds of all but the subjects. <br/>Other Moves<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mint Mutants <br/>Sex Move<br/>When you have sex, you replace a part of your body with a part of theirs. You become more real and they more immaterial. <br/>Darkest Self<br/>You are an extension of your plague. What you touch is infected. You\u2019re going to die horribly and join the quiet damned, who shouldn\u2019t your enemies as well. <br/>Advancement<br/>  Take another Mint move.<br/>\x81\uf081Take another Mint move.<br/>\x81\uf081Take a move from another Skin.<br/>\x81\uf081Take a move from another Skin.<br/>\x81\uf081You have Pain Lesseners.<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Sweet (max 3).<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Sour (max 3).<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Smokey (max 3).<br/>\x81\uf081Add 1 to Biter (max 3).<br/>Playing The Mint Mutant<br/>A sad carrier of the peanut brittle bone disease referred to as the peppermint plague, your days are numbered. Your body will slowly candify into fragile mint and one day you will become a frozen statue like your brothers. However, there is hope. Others can slow your demise by taking some of your disease into their body. But who would be willing to do that? They would have to really love you, which is hard, because you are driven to kill by your madness\u2026did I forget to mention that? <br/>Name<br/>Name<br/>Choose a name:<br/>Bandy, Morgon, Roachly, Dominic, Sarahbin, Momo, Tolgy, Tremmer, Susie, Reganly<br/>A common name, peasant\u2019s name, a name implying servitude, a name implying tribulation<br/>Look<br/>Circle one in each list:<br/>strong, stubborn, average, tough, scared, doomed<br/>wavering eyes, fearful eyes, hopeful eyes, scared eyes, red and white eyes<br/>Origin<br/>Circle one:<br/>bitten, cursed, STD?, infected, genetic <br/>You already lost a limb to the plague<br/>Circle one:<br/>Arm, Leg, Foot, Fingers, Neck, Hair <br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>Name:<br/><br/>Carry Forward<br/>Conditions<br/>Notes<br/>Harm <br/>Experience Points:<br/>\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf06dadvance <br/>Your Backstory<br/>You have someone who has promised to help you.

On a 10 up, you take the harm instead of them, but reduce it by 1. \u2022 On a 7-9, you take the harm instead of them.<br/>\uf06dLight the Way<br/>Whenever your friends follow through on your commands or your lead, they add 1 to their roll.
