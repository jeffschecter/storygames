At least, more than none. We still joked about making slash fic of our characters.<br/><br/>I think slash fic maybe comes from that thing you describe, where we have these internal lives that are usually pretty obsessed with sex "does this person like me?" "<i>like me</i> like me?" "I wonder what it would be like to have sex with so-and-so". And sex is a pretty big part of our social landscape too. And then we play games and watch tv and read books, and a lot of the time that part of people's lives is just absent.<br/><br/>We're supposed to imagine that Spock never had a secret crush on <i>anyone</i> his whole tenure on the Enterprise? That Wolverine <i>never</i> got a broner off Cyclops?<br/><br/>I think we're shy about admitting sexuality into our RPG play because we're shy about admitting how much sexuality is a part of our daily lives. I think sex is fucked up in so many rpgs because sex is fucked up in so much of our culture.<br/><br/>But I say let's drag that shit out into the open! Let's expose the fucked-up underbelly of our minds. Air our dirty laundry! We have nothing to lose but our hang-ups!<br/><br/>I'd love to talk about this with regards to this game I'm making called "Dungeonfuckers" as well, but it's maybe too early.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304430/#Comment_304430" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T15:17:40+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  3:17PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every single <i>Breaking the Ice</i> session that I played with my ex-girlfriend ended up as something similar to a soft-porn movie.

It involved a very messy sort of sexiness indeed - that of beautiful, jagged women who manage to play the Gun Thief's sympathies. Gun Thief was an exploration of a very specific thing, and the sexuality present in the game is pretty limited and specific as well. It's the kind of sexiness you see in The Wrestler, or in all three of Sin City's major story arcs (the movie), or even Black Snake Moan - that of a beautiful, jagged woman who can rock the hell out of a low-cut top and a cigarette, but can't seem to keep herself out of trouble, searching for something she won't find in a man who's got a heart of gold but a body made out of scars and stone. It's a sexiness that I'm incredibly drawn to in fiction, in a way that I totally understand is problematic. It's a sexiness I'd never want to duplicate, but it's still got its damn tendrils inside my brain. That's part of what Gun Thief is about.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b> is much broader, but its sexuality is problematic too. It's a game about teenagers and monsters, in the vein of Twilight, Buffy, The Craft, Ginger Snaps, Jennifer's Body and True Blood. The mechanics (based off of Apocalypse World) turn emotions into battlefields, and sexuality into leverage. <br/><br/>So, uh, why is that? Why am I drawn to games that have problematic, messy sexuality at their core? Why am I designing them?<br/><br/>I think that a big part of it is that I am drawn to that in fiction. To grimy, messy stories where people are desperate and horny. To stories about coming of age, and suffering some big "learning moments" along the way. My favourite fiction is deeply problematic, problematic enough that I need to struggle with big questions as I digest it: does this sort of stuff really happen? does this hold a mirror to something in myself? what would I do in that situation? would I want that kind of fire?<br/><br/>It might just be a safe exploration of a dangerous thing. Or it might be that there's something, deep inside my head, that I'm trying to claw my way to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304463/#Comment_304463" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T18:22:49+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  6:22PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been wondering something about this for a little while now; our gaming group steers clear of sexual situations in our games, keeping fairly close to an Old Hollywood standard, where you can <i>imply</i> romance and sex and things like that but you never, ever <i>show</i> it.  Characters who are in love bicker with each other or coo at each other in an all-ages-friendly way, characters with sex lives keep it strictly off-screen and without any specific details, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>My suspicion is that this has a lot to do with real-life social boundaries:  we are essentially people who do not discuss our sex lives or sexual fantasies or even sexual opinions with anyone other than the people we are actually having sex with.  None of us are comfortable or interested in having those kinds of discussions with even close friends whom we've known for years and years and with whom we discuss any number of other highly personal topics.  (Speaking for myself, it just seems...inappropriate to talk about it.  I don't exactly know why, but it must be how I was brought up: what people get up to in private is no one's business but their own, and it feels like violating my partner's trust and discarding the intimacy of our relationship to discuss it with uninvolved third parties, etc..)<br/><br/>But obviously, other groups and other people apparently do put at least some sex into their games...which makes me wonder if that goes hand-in-hand with (more) open discussion of their real sex lives.  Or is it some kind of transgressive thing, where the appeal lies in framing things in a "safe" context that you ordinarily shy away from introducing into "real" conversations?  Or perhaps some combination of the two, or something else entirely?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304465/#Comment_304465" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T18:44:17+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  6:44PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good questions, Accounting.<br/><br/>I know that you have to work pretty hard to get me to shut up about my sex life, in the right context, so the fact that I like sexy games might be linked to that.<br/><br/>But there is also that frisson of taking things a little further than people are comfortable with, of exploring ideas that you might not otherwise talk about. <br/><br/>There's a feeling I'mtrying to describe, kind of a tingling, hot feeling, like the air is suddenly alive with electricity, when the game veers into territory where no one quite feels safe.

While pretending to be other characters people will occasionally "get real."  I can harvest glimpses of humanity from role-playing that I don't get from tedious small talk at a dozen typical social gatherings.<br/><br/>Sex is maybe the seventh most important arena in my life.  (For context, I'd judge it as being in the top three for most 18-34 year-olds).  It's always struck me as odd that it's been absent from <i>most</i> role-playing game texts and play until relatively recently.  I feel no great demand for sexiness in role-playing games, but sexual situations are interesting to me and I prefer they be occasionally present than the generally sterile alternative.<br/><br/>Sex and sexiness in games is interesting for some of the same reasons vulnerability, mortality, and the denial of death are interesting.<br/><br/>That "+1 for fucking " comment is hilarious.  The main reason I chose a brainer as my first Apocalypse World character was the deep brain scan move it triggers.

Description alone doesn\u2019t do it for me either. I love bringing relational stuff into games \u2013 it\u2019s a quick way engage emotionally and it usually adds a lot to the game because of it. Even though it\u2019s fiction, doing so makes you a bit vulnerable as a player, which is great if you love a good story gut punch. Multiple times I\u2019ve added potentially sexy additions to a game \u2013 anything from aggressively pursuing a love interest to dropping subtle hints, but it ultimately requires willing reciprocation from the other player. Sometimes other players just aren\u2019t interested and other times they love a good unrequited love story, which still makes for an engaging game. But the sexy games? Those are the games where another player gets what you\u2019re doing and wants to go there too. Doesn\u2019t even have to be sex. Just the electric hint of it. <br/><br/>I mentioned willing reciprocation because there are some games out there where you can manipulate another character in the way they relate to your character. How We Came to Live Here and Misery Bubblegum come to mind. These games can both be very sexy, but because it\u2019s possible to mechanically manipulate other characters, you may also get love or sex in the fiction without it feeling sexy to the players. <br/><br/>Other games like Kagematsu, The Mountain Witch (if you pull the obsessive love Dark Fate), and Shooting the Moon can also be very sexy (or involve a lot of sensual and sexual content, Kagematsu especially), but they can all easily take on a certain desperation if the hoped for lover withdraws. And that can get downright ugly (but still awesome as the story goes).<br/><br/>The games I\u2019ve played that have provided a more reliable means to sexiness (or any good emotional bonds for that matter) tend to involve a feeling of camaraderie among the players and their characters (starting out as a team or friends somehow) in desperate conditions, like in Misspent Youth or Grey Ranks. <br/><br/>Jeepform and other more freeform games like Under My Skin can be pretty sexy too, as they often tackle emotional issues, but they\u2019re often mixed bags. I\u2019ve encountered both some of the most sexy and most horrifying sex/relational stories of any games (which, for an emo gut punch story lover like me keeps me coming back!).<br/><br/>Also worth mentioning: long term campaigns like those you can get from Burning Wheel and Burning Empires are awesome for developing multifaceted, deep relationships that can be incredibly sexy. My favorite was an unlikely pair that developed and slow cooked for months and through many adventures and awkward situations in a BW game (a PC &amp; an NPC). In the midst of a world gone crazy they were both struggling with religious restrictions and they managed to keep chaste until their wedding, but the sexual tension was fantastic.  <br/><br/>I don\u2019t know how much it has to do with talking about sex in real life. Some, I suspect. But I don\u2019t discuss sex all the often with friends even though I bring it into many games. I guess I feel like a story is incomplete if emotional connections haven\u2019t been made and sexual situations are an easy way (but not the only way) to do this. I am all in favor of more sexiness in games. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304489/#Comment_304489" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T01:03:55+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  1:03AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>You can't just give people +1 for fucking and expect it to work.</blockquote>\nGod I hope this becomes the Walmsley Principle.<br/><br/>- Ryan<br/><br/>Well it already has, right now, hasn't it?<br/><br/>Well, I kinda feel wierd now, because my position is the opposite of Rachel's. I have a loathing for romantic play in rpgs, but kinda like explicit sexual scenes. Maybe because I loathe romanticism in life, maybe because I'm fed up on how NARrativism so often translates into focusing on relationships, and especially romantic relationships. I don't know if it's something especially true for Italy or common to the entire rpg scene. But that is what made me just <b>love</b> Mars Colony with its focus on politics (thank you Tim for reminding us that NAR does not equal romantic drama), and loathe with all myself Kagematsu. Now that is a game I've seen playing and which made me say "no way I'm going to play this". <br/>Oh and Montsegur. That's another game where sexiness is very present. Since the religious overtone is so marked, concepts such as "chastity" and "sin" come in forward in a pretty spontaneous way. Which leads to prohibited relationships, chastisation of the senses, uncontrollable desire, sense of guilt towards god. I've witnessed (and done myself!) the most gut wrenching emo porn scenes I ever remember... in both it was just romanticism and cry-me-a-river drama, never escalating into actual sex scenes, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304490/#Comment_304490" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T01:39:00+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  1:39AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite><br/>Oh and Montsegur.

Themes close the blood of humanity, close to life. Sex is play; story-telling is play. I'm still thinking about my own question and asking new ones: How do we do better than +1 for fucking?

And then they wrinkle up their noses and think I'm inflicting my fetish on them. Which I hate when other people do. And which, I'm not. I just happen to share the opinion of Nathan and think sex is a part of the everyday life of every human, shouldn't it be a part of the stories I tell too?<br/><br/>It's weird, cause in RPGs, how do you address this? What is your audience? Should it be a mechanic, or just included instead of excluded? Depends on what you're writing, I guess. I've always thought that White Wolf dealt with it pretty well (barring certain books, mind you). Vampires and all, it's pretty much always about the sex metaphor. And the goth scene, which, y'know, totally teen angst. I think Dresden does it well for pretty similar reasons. Hm, what else. Lots of games I can't think of, heh.<br/><br/>I think this might be one of those things that boils down to the group you're in. Are you 16 year olds who are entrenched in newfound sexual politics? Are you adults who are kinda conservative? Do you like fantasy that's kinda more like Tolkein? I'm not sure how to tackle this one... it's such a broad topic. I often find my tastes are in conflict with my group's, and sex or romance is shunted to the side to be replaced with action and politics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304538/#Comment_304538" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T08:42:18+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  8:42AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>I often find myself having this discussion with my gaming friends.

The sex move.  I knew the minute someone looked at a playbook, those words were going to jump out at them, and they'd probably reject the game out of hand.<br/><br/>"Should I mention it beforehand? Should I explain lines/veils? Maybe talk about how it's an important *part* of the game, but not the center of it. Wait, maybe I'm making things worse by overexplaining myself. Maybe I shouldn't say anything about it. No, wait, then we might sit down at the table and they'll be all "Sex move? I thought this was a post-apocalyptic game, WTF?". Wait, wait...maybe I should...no, that won't work either....aaaagh!" *headdesk*<br/><br/>Sexual and romantic themes are not specifically why I got into indie games. Not having to wait through 3-hour combats for my story nugget was. But I'm a grownup, playing games about people, and sex and love and people doing crazy/ugly/beautiful things because of them are part of what makes stories good.  And, while dealing with these things in play can be awkward for me sometimes I think it's worth the effort in the depth it adds to the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304540/#Comment_304540" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T08:55:39+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  8:55AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2010 8:58AM by Epidiah_Ravachol.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Time &amp; Temp sex is strictly forbidden.

I think it's easier to get on the same page about action, violence, intrigue, horror, etc., since we gamers as a group tend to consume a lot of that kind of material in our reading, movies, etc.  We have those shared images and ideas that help us figure out what we'd like to see at the table.  Not so much with matters of the heart, or genitals.  <br/><br/>While I like to introduce sex and romance into my games, I tend to do it gingerly in my main group because I don't know them that well, and I don't want to squick anybody out.  But as we get to know each other's comfort levels, there's room for more of that.<br/><br/>I don't know how interested I'd be in a game that's focused on sex and relationships.  As a sideline or subplot or setting, yes, please.  But not as the main story.  <br/><br/>An example of how this works for me: in a recent Shock game, I played an astronaut-in-training who was in conflict with a colleague who had died and had her mind copied.  We had a PG-13/R-rated scene which involved the astronaut seducing his ex-wife where the colleague could "see" it, as a sort of "see what you're missing now" mind game.  I had a lot of fun with it, but I don't think I'd be interested in a story about an astronaut and his ex-wife that included a subplot about his conflict with an uploaded colleague.  Romantic/sexual element supporting an SF story, yes.  SF element supporting a romance/sex story, no.  A fine but meaningful distinction for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Which can be fun, silly or problematic - just like porn or other spectacular fantasies. Fantasies which most of us can distinguish from reality.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not keen on stating whether a game should or shouldn't have sex in it.  I'd rather talk about my own views and I would be wary of sexing up my games.  I tend to draw veils when people are getting it on in RPGs as I tend to game with people whom I'm not emotionally close and for me there needs to be a degree of intimacy and trust to bring these matters in.<br/><br/>Talking about sex can render it unsexy.  I'm sure many of us have sat listening to crass conversations in the office where someone is describing fucking.  I really try hard to imagine this described scene and most often find myself as limp as a dishcloth, especially if I have no professional respect for them.  <br/><br/>The OP describes themselves as polyamourous, implying sex as being shared with many.  I'm mainly monoamourous.  In my mind there is an overlap between RPGs and sexual role-play/fetish stuff but I wouldn't feel comfortable posting on this site about it.  That's not who I am here.<br/><br/>The other thing is the sexual and the erotic seem rather confused in some of the above posts.  To me the erotic is the hint of sex in the air and its potential denial.<br/><br/>Sex is a part of the social landscape in some ways - I'm all for education about safe sex.  Equally there is something forbidden in discussing it publicly.  I object as a heterosexual male to having "sexy" images stuck in my face by advertising and sub pornographic magazine, like Nuts and Zoo that have the same airbrushed teens in them.  I feel like I'm being told and sold what is sexy and that instantly renders it unsexy.<br/><br/>Don't forget - we have a role-playing game that promises to take us into this taboo, groundbreaking area.  It's called F.A.T.A.L.<br/><br/>edit -<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVT9FlY_0rY" rel="nofollow">THIS</a> makes the whole sex-talk point well                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304714/#Comment_304714" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T18:33:19+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  6:33PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it should be there if it fits, but I don't think every game needs to be sexier.

I don't think you can draw a clear line between violence in-game and violence in real life. I mean, obviously they're not the same thing, but they're not completely separate either.<br/><br/>So, sexy play. For sure, just because you're flirting with their character doesn't mean that you're tring to have sex with them, for sure. But I think it is, like, "hey, let's be sexual people together! Let's show that side of ourselves. Let's expose that vulnerability." <br/><br/>I can totally get why some people don't want that in their games. I don't want it in all my games either. But I think it's what makes the good ones really good, for me.<br/><br/>Hang on, let me find a thing I said a while ago on Vincent's blog:\n<blockquote><cite>A while ago I said...</cite>roleplaying is a really intimate, intense, vulnerable act. It's kinda sexy, even. But for a lot of us we learnt to play, and most of our experiences of play are with groups of just men (or boys) often during adolescence, a time of incredible insecurity, messed up interpersonal relationships, and frequntly homophobia (and the attendant hatred of the feminine, and anything that makes you vulnerable). Basically, roleplaying is kinda gay, so we butch it up with swords and guns and fighting and shit.<br/><br/>I think we also inherit from that tradition a stringent divide between players and characters. I think a lot of games really strictly police that boundary, maintaining the fiction that it's just a game, that it's not personal.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304746/#Comment_304746" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T00:05:18+00:00" title="December 16, 2010 12:05AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, so there's no controversy about needing to play with people you trust, and maybe sexy games are risky at cons, etc.  Cool.  <br/><br/>Sexy bits of games not already mentioned:<br/><br/>One of the 6 major ambitions in several (all?) <b>Fiasco</b> playsets is "To get laid."

When you leave your comfort zone, a typical reaction is to joke about it and burst the tension. Very efficient in sex and horror, but totally destroys the flow.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not sure I agree that it's a problem: as has been pointed out, there's a hell of a lot of comedic potential there, maybe more than there is dramatic potential.  Really, the more I think about it, the more mysterious it seems that the vast majority of the games that do try to include some degree of sexiness do so seriously (mostly mining it for melodrama and/or wish-fulfillment), instead of taking advantage of the sublime ridiculousness of it all.<br/><br/>Like jokes in a horror game, I suspect it only destroys the flow when you're trying to direct that flow in an unnatural direction; if you let it take its own course, the jokes fit right in and you end up gaining more than you thought you were losing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304758/#Comment_304758" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T01:49:52+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  1:49AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>"grimy, messy stories where people are desperate and horny."<br/><br/>Joe, you know I love Monsterhearts, but could you talk about how you took AW (already about relationship and gritty, sexy stories) and made in about monstrous horny teens? Or how you design to produce those particular kinds of narratives?</blockquote>\nRight now, I feel like I can answer only the first of those two questions. The second one is, like, I'm not confident on answering it without more playtesting to verify that process.<br/><br/>So, how to hack AW to make it about monstrous horny teens:<br/>1.) Become obsessed with Twilight.<br/>1a.) Become disgusted with how poorly written Twilight is, and how fucked up and damaging its stories are.<br/>1b.) Become obsessed with Twilight's fucked up, damaging stories. Begin to like them.<br/>1c.) Wonder why that is.<br/>1d.) Start compulsively watching teen monster sex dramas.<br/><br/>2.) Become obsessed with Apocalypse World.<br/>2a.) Specifically, become obsessed with the concept of holds.<br/>2b.) Think to one's self, "Gee, that describes like 9/10ths of the Twilight series."<br/>2c.) Realize that there's a game there, waiting to be written.<br/><br/>3.) Reinvent Apocalypse World as a game about holds - endlessly collecting them, always threatening to use them.<br/>3a.) What if holds represented how much control you had over someone's heart? What if you could just walk into someone's life and start owning it?<br/>3b.) To make that interesting, you need some dark options for breaking that cycle.<br/>3c.) Ruminate on the phrase, "When you become your darkest self..."<br/><br/>4.) Clarify what the game is about: sex, codependency, love, belonging, darkest, sorrow, power.<br/>4a.) Cut from the game everything that isn't about those things: weapons, equipment, barter, "read a situation," "read a person."<br/>4b.) Take anything that's barely made the cut, and re-design it: hx, seize by force/go aggro, wounds.<br/><br/>5.) Watch True Blood, Buffy and Jennifer's Body obsessively.<br/>5a.) Can you picture a sexy zombie? Then write it. Can you picture a sexy symbiotic demon? Then write it.<br/>5b.) Ask oneself: how is the ghoul sexy? how is the ghoul dysfunctional? how is the ghoul dangerous?<br/><br/>6.) Reach back to one's own teenage years. They aren't that far back.<br/>6a.) Find one's own darkness. Find one's own teenage monstrosity.<br/>6b.) Put that on the page.

You're playing a game. Isn't roleplaying like acting in a movie or the stage? Just because you're playing a character that just kissed your friend's character doesn't mean you want to kiss your friend. Is this where we get into that whole "it's just what my character would do" argument? I mean, you drive your characters motivations, so is the implication that secretly, you want to kiss your friend? I think that's a weird implication. I wouldn't want to kill my friend, or steal from my friend, or other things that most rpg's encourage you to do.<br/><br/>I can draw the line between my character's actions and my own. People have boundaries with what they're comfortable doing with their characters and what they're not with all kinds of things. Some people are uncomfortable playing a racist character, or a serial rapist. Understandable. But, I dunno, I don't think sex should be in that category of highly uncomfortable things to roleplay. In the "sex exists, even if we're not describing it ad nauseum xxx rated scenes, isn't this how babies are made? aren't i rescuing the princess because i love her?" kind of basic way. I guess there's lots of nuance with it. Sexy in a James Bond way is different than sexy in a Jersey Shore way.<br/><br/>Maybe people are uncomfortable roleplaying these things because most rpg lineage starts with DnD, a fantasy setting based on Tolkein whose story, while it has touches of romance, is more focused on adventuring and war. Maybe a lot of fantasy has this childish feel about it, that doesn't delve into more adult ideas about sex and sexuality.

I don't want to exclude violence from design and play but I do want to shift the balance in favour of relationships, sex and drama. It also begs another more profound question without an easy answer: why are we more comfortable with brutal yet causal violence at the table whereas even flirting seems taboo? Moreover, why don't we feel like violence mechanics aren't gimmicky? I've been in a few fights and I'm fair shot with a rifle and I can tell you that every 'violence mechanic' I have seen is basically what Monopoly is to Wall Street.<br/><br/>I also want to draw the distinction between 'possibly sexy' games (basically all RPGs) and explicitly sexy games (IE AW's sex move, It's Complicated, The Gun Thief, &amp;c). Sexy content can be added to pretty much any game at any time, but few games make mechanics provisions for it mechanically.

Perhaps one reason roleplaying games aren't sexy is because the people around the table are often straight men.

The issue comes up when you try to go beyond beer and pretzel's roleplaying, which some people do wish to achieve, from time to time (at least me).<br/><br/>In any case, this defense mechanism is more general, you can do the same with an horror movie, and you can imagine how it can ruin the mood for the audience if someone starts to make fun of a horror movie. For sure, I've been to horror movie festivals where that was the whole point, and it's fun, but from time to time you'd actually like to see "shining" without someone making derisive remarks at your side. It's that kind of problem I was alluding to.\n<blockquote><br/>Like jokes in a horror game, I suspect it only destroys the flow when you're trying to direct that flow in an unnatural direction; if you let it take its own course, the jokes fit right in and you end up gaining more than you thought you were losing.</blockquote>\nJokes are great in a horror or tragedy play/game, but only if they are used as a "breather", to jump into more intense stuff. Of course, you if make a cross between discworld and cthulhu, jokes are most welcome anytime. As for the "unnatural" direction, that could be another way of meaning going out of the "comfort zone" for someone. I have repeatedly seen people unconsciously reverting to irony when they feel that the game should not go beyond a certain point.<br/><br/>Of course, it's ok if people have limits, the problem is when people consciously want something, but their behavior shows otherwise. I sometimes am aware of this incoherence in myself when I'm playing, and I'm used to see it in others. For instance, the whole point of roleplaying games is to impersonate someone else, but usually I'm shy of really "impersonating" someone, I tend to prefer "commenting/narrating" his actions, even though I would wish to "impersonate".<br/><br/>Same thing for sex. Nobody is against having more of it during the games, but nobody found a way to do it in a comfortable way for every one around the table.<br/><br/>Also, I must say that our gaming group has been 50% men 50% women, so it does not seem to be related to gender distribution. Perhaps the fact that it's people I don't speak about sex with could have something to do with it, I'm not sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304889/#Comment_304889" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T13:23:41+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  1:23PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This weekend we begin our HELLAS campaign. <br/><br/>I am an Amazoran Whoremaster.<br/><br/>Basically like the "companion" from Firefly, but more like a "companion's madam/pit boss".

People (normally) doesn't want to cry. Making people laugh is easier. Most people like laughing. That is why it's easier to relate to a comedic character or situation. And the skilled actor knows that if you make people laugh, they are opening the (emotional) doors for you. And afterward it is easier to make them cry."<br/><br/>Not exactly the same thing, but I think the principle holds true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304903/#Comment_304903" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T15:21:18+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  3:21PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to chime in and say my girlfriend, Carly, agrees with you 100% Orly.

Last night we gamed, were recording, and there was sex, though, so at least as a case study I can talk about sex in Diaspora.<br/><br/>Here's what happened. We're modeling a research effort -- we have an alien space craft in quarantine facilities and we want to find out it's PURPOSE, IMPACT, NEEDS, and ORIGIN. We do this with social combat: a grid map, each fact on the map, and each character on the map. And a rule for counting victory: any fact in the same zone as two characters at the end is known. The research lasts four turns (we have a strict deadline).<br/><br/>Now the game proper is about moving things on the map and making movement between nodes harder. You roll skills to do that. But the narrative overlaid that is the story of the research, so a fact nicely corralled with two characters is a fact we are confident we know. If it leaves that space, then it is a fact we thought we knew. And so on -- we make sense of the motion of the pawns on the board in terms of people and facts and research.<br/><br/>So at one point JB as Zeke is trying to figure out a way to use his Charm because that skill is very high on his character's sheet but his better skill was used last time so he cant use it. Last time he used his Bureaucracy to bring in an expert from the Church to assist. So this time he narrates that she has been sabotaging our results and Zeke needs to expose her and he will try to seduce her (or at least flatter her) so that she lets it slip. He fails.<br/><br/>On Brad's (playing Myriad) turn it seems obviously hilarious if he succeeds where JB failed, so he brings Charm to the table too (which he never thought to do) and manages to undermine her chastity as well as her cover, exposing her as a Church agent, possibly disgracing her with the church, and after comparing notes with Zeke, maybe humiliating Zeke a little too.<br/><br/>It was light, funny, tactically wise, and a little sexy. It was a natural derivation of the game facts at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305007/#Comment_305007" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T12:58:31+00:00" title="December 17, 2010 12:58PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2010 12:58PM by Brendan_Conway.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hoping someone can help me understand the nature of bringing sex to games a little better. I know it's been explained above, but for some reason it's not gelling with my own understanding, so I wanted to use metaphorical examples.<br/><br/>Are we talking about bringing sex to games in the way that sex is in True Blood, or are we talking about bringing sex to games in the way that sex is in Mad Men? Or both? <br/><br/>First, I will explain my own predispositions, before explaining those terms, exactly. I am not a fan of True Blood, for a number of reasons, including the way they deal with sex. I am a fervent fan of Mad Men. <br/><br/>My understanding of sex in True Blood: it's there to be titillating, to be sex for the sake of sex, so that we can enjoy pretty people doing the nasty on the television screen. There have only been a couple of times that I've seen sex in True Blood where I've actually thought that the depiction of sex added to drama or story, so I came to the conclusion that the way True Blood shows sex is for the sex.<br/><br/>My understanding of sex in Mad Men: it's there to serve the drama and the characterization. I can only think of one, maybe two instances where Mad Men really "showed" sex, and definitely not in the same way that True Blood did. And yet, sex happens in Mad Men all the friggin' time. What's more important in Mad Men are the events leading up to the sex, and the events following the sex. So sex in Mad Men is very dramatic and story-oriented in its purpose; it's never "just" there for the sake of sex. <br/><br/>I'm not calling either one better than the other, to be clear; I am saying that I do not like what I perceive as the True Blood style, whereas I do like what I perceive as the Mad Men style. I do think there's room enough in gaming at large for both styles, but I don't know if any particular game can do both at once. So I'm interested if this conversation is primarily about one over the other, or if they're both in here. Also, if anyone has a different point of view on these styles, or thinks I'm oversimplifying it, please share.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305012/#Comment_305012" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T14:08:27+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  2:08PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan Conway</cite><br/>I'm not calling either one better than the other, to be clear; I am saying that I do not like what I perceive as the True Blood style, whereas I do like what I perceive as the Mad Men style.

It's when you want to be titillated. If you want to be titillated at the gaming table, and everyone else does too, that's awesome. I've played a game of Vampire: the Masquerade that was very much like that - I introduced an NPC who was a powerful dude who led two sexy ladies around on chains, like they were his pets. I mean, they were ghouls, they totally were his pets. One of the players immediately had a glint in her eye, and I could tell what she was asking herself: <i>is there any way that it'd be advantageous for me to be on the end of one of those metal leashes? Because if so, I totally want that.</i> It was 100% playing for titillation, and it was 100% what the group wanted. We didn't want a sexy story. We wanted hot people leading other hot people around on chains.<br/><br/><i>Gun Thief</i> plays to the titillation angle, not the subtle eros angle.<br/><br/>But, the Mad Men variety, as you christened it, is wonderful and something that needs to be explored more! I think there's room for it in gaming, too. <i>Breaking the Ice, Under My Skin</i> and <i>It's Complicated</i> definitely play towards this style. Apocalypse World can go in this direction, despite the fact that there are those sex moves leaping out at you to drive towards the nasty. I think that the Mad Men style is definitely trickier to achieve, because it requires a great deal more trust and sincerity.<br/><br/>I don't think it's impossible for the two styles to work together, either. Most successful teen sex comedies (American Pie, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, etc) have a lead or prominent character who's searching for something beautiful and real with the girl/boy of their dreams, while couching it in crude terms in order to appeal to their friends. The interplay between senseless titillation and brief glimpses of infatuated and sincere interest is what makes those movies interesting, when it happens. Fast Times at Ridgemont High has this one scene that's positively beautiful and endearing. It also has a scene where a boy is masturbating to the thought of this girl, and then she walks into the bathroom without knocking. So, there's that.<br/><br/>So: I think this thread could be about either, depending on what we collectively bring to the table. I've had my fun with the "True Blood" sexiness, and probably will have more fun with it in the future. But that "Mad Men" sexiness, well, I want more of it at my game table. Even if we need to splash some "True Blood" sexiness into it in order to get to that goal.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305048/#Comment_305048" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T01:16:21+00:00" title="December 18, 2010  1:16AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [delurks] - it's a footnote to the main subject of the thread, but might be worth mentioning - LARP has been brought up as a place where sexy play happens and happens a lot, and the gender balance of participants was mentioned and discarded as an explanation. My feeling is the sexy thrives in LARP because of *discretion*. You do your sexy flirting or whatever without being the focus of a silent audience; everyone else has their own stuff going on.

I haven't played many, or any, games where titillation was a big theme, but that's just my tastes. Apocalypse World, I think, drives steadfastly towards Mad Men style sex because of the entanglements and relationships that can spring out of any sexual relation in the game. Really, I feel that the sex move mechanics of AW are simply incentivizing sex with mechanics, even when those mechanics are not explicitly good for the character. <br/><br/>I think my only qualm is that I don't think "True Blood" sexiness is necessary for "Mad Men" sexiness, but yeah, I'm totally willing to say that if "TB" is necessary for "MM," then bring on the "TB," because the "MM" is worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305727/#Comment_305727" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T11:01:57+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 11:01AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan Conway</cite>Titillation the game mechanic: Every time you say the word "titillation," you gain 1 point of hotness.
