Alvin Frewer, Spinachcat and Colin have given excellent suggestsion and advice off forum and I'd like to open this discussion up even more.  I have a very specific agenda and it's a formidable challenge.<br/><br/>To save you from having to wade through the entire thread, the salient posts are mine at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2344&amp;Mode=like">#44</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2359&amp;Mode=like">#59</a>.  Those three sum up what I'm looking for (and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2344&amp;Mode=like">#44</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2359&amp;Mode=like">#59</a> are further refinements of my original post #1).  CK's post is at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2354&amp;Mode=like">#54</a><br/><br/>If you don't want to post over there, 'tis cool.  Feel free to post replies over here on this thread.  I'll be looking both places.<br/><br/>Thanks for your help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
