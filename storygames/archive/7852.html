Arun?).  I'm running a playtest at Endgame soon, but it's still very much a work in progress, so I invite comments, questions, and suggestions via email to cdr AT telemancy.com.<br/><br/>Note that I'm not trying to duplicate Shadowrun exactly, but more like the game and setting I enjoyed running when Shadowrun first came out, closer to "Ghost in the Shell" mixed with Shinto.  It's the future, magic has returned, everything has awoken, and technology is changing what it means to be human.  In a world where the old ways of living no longer work, Shadowrunners are creating new myths.<br/><br/>Agon's appeal was its emphasis on Glory (now Rep) through struggle, and the limited Strife budget so challenges scale with the ability of the characters, which is very appealing in a setting where Runners accept pocket change to tick off billion-nuyen megacorps.<br/><br/>I'll report back after the playtest, and the rules (linked to from the above link) will likely be updating daily throughout October as they improve or at least change.  Many thanks to John Harper for the use of his system and conversion as a base.  It will be very handy to have a copy of <a href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow"><em>Agon</em></a> to follow along.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174037/#Comment_174037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T05:56:55+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  5:56AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 5:58AM by J_Walton.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet, Carl.  I was stealing from John's unfinished Shadowrun hack for my own crusaderpunk hack (Agonia), so now I have another source to steal from as well.  Awesome.  Look forward to hearing how it goes.
