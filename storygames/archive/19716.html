They had to put up with the empire\u2019s army camp near their town. The soldiers, bearing the arrogance of those who consider themselves heroes, occupied their time in savagery, abuses and feast. The day prior to the battle, more than half of Ulfruntadt\u2019s inhabitants had left the town, among them their mayor.<br/>And finally the day came. By the night, there were still no news about the battle. And the night went on an on, endlessly: nobody knew wether it was an illusion caused by their anxiety, or they were cursed (this caused many arguments). Some brave villagers risked their lives to go out and explore: few returned, but those who did told everyone what they had seen, and drew a crude map.</i><br/><br/>Hi! <a href="http://editorialrunica.blogspot.com.ar/2014/08/la-noche-eternathe-endless-night.html" rel="nofollow">Runica Publishing </a>has released it's first adventure. It's a short scenario inspired by microdungeons and microscenarios like Island of the lizard god, so it all fits in two A4 pages. It comes with info to run it with World of Dungeons, but it's simple enough to be run with any other (simple) fantasy game.<br/><br/>Since it is our first adventure, we'll highly apreciate any feedback (also in the quality of the translation, since English is not my native language). You'll get one hugcoin for every 100 words of feedback, which you can change for a free hug in the case you just happen to be in Mar del Plata, Argentina : p.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it : )<br/><br/><b><a href="http://goo.gl/5jw5gk" rel="nofollow">I'M A DOWNLOAD LINK</a></b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ul_fG-uGcT4/U_umRdy61II/AAAAAAAAATA/0-GMnjlcUKA/s1600/The%2Bendless%2Bnight-eng.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437792/#Comment_437792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T10:54:46+00:00" title="August 26, 2014 10:54AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks cool!
