There is also a large kitchen table with five chairs as well as plenty of worktop space for food preparation. A full list of contents will be posted nearer the time of the convention.<br/>\nSome of the kitchens may not be fully stocked with all the items due to <i>natural shrinkage</i> with contact with the students.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust off the kitchen is the lounge area. The lounge has a large window lets in plenty of daylight. There are five comfy lounge chairs and a small coffee table making this a nice place to relax in. There are ten chairs in total in the kitchen/lounge making it very useful for running games in, you can either be in the lounge or around the table in the kitchen. There is plenty of space to move about, even for those of us who are 'standard gamer size'!<br/>\nWith each flat having this extra space ideal for gaming this opens up the possibility that more games can be ran during the convention. Just book the time and space with your flatmates first. Advertise your game with pavilion name and flat number and your gamers can arrive at your pavilion and ring your doorbell to be let in. Or just run the game for all your flatmates, whether you know them or not, simple!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be issued a set of keys when you register at the main reception desk in the Conference Facilities Building. The main key will open the door to your flat as well as your own bedroom door. The little key will open the post box in the pavilion entrance foyer and the key fob itself will open the main door to the pavilion electronically. The flats are numbered 1 to 8 while the bedrooms in each flat are lettered A to E.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll accommodation will be single occupancy bedrooms with en suite bathroom. You will be issued a set of towels and some basic toiletries but you will need to bring with you your own wash kits, bathrobes and other personal hygiene items. The bathroom will have toilet roll and the single bed will have fresh bed sheets, two pillows with fresh pillowcases and a duvet with bedspread.<br/>\nThere is a desk in your bedroom with built-in drawers, shelves by the window, a desk lamp, mini-kettle with a small selection of tea/coffee condiments, two power sockets, a phone, and an Internet connection. We do not currently have a list of the charges for using the phone or connecting to the Internet as yet.<br/>\nNext to the desk is a medium-sized wardrobe with space to hang clothes as well as plenty of shelves to store folded clothes or other items.<br/>\nThe en suite bathroom, consisting of toilet, washbasin and shower cubicle, is located as you enter the bedroom. It has its own lockable door and is light and airy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing about this accommodation is that it is brand new. Very little wear &amp; tear would have happened over the two years that it has been opened and even students will treat things better when they are new!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="716181718_ca034d860e.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/716181718_ca034d860e.jpg"/><br/>\n<i>The front of the Pavilion [accommodation blocks].

There is civil unrest; the filthy underbelly of the city has rolled itself over for all to view and the Alliance are not happy. Tongs and Triads roam the streets, muscling in on the companies of 'legitimate businessmen', smugglers, whores and Browncoats keep rearing their ugly heads. The local garrison is spread thin, especially since the fire bombing of the Glorious Ole Opera and adjoining buildings. To make matters worse, Governor Macon has chosen this time of discord to further the objectives of his Electoral campaign and seeks to meet and greet the fair folks of the Docks. You can be assured that his rivals will be doing likewise. Combine that with the discord amongst the Companions Guild and Miss Dahlia and you have a whole heap of trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nData: "You Can't Take the Sky from me..." is a freeform role-playing game for 25 players, set in the wonderful setting of Joss Whedon's <i>Firefly/Serenity </i>'verse.
