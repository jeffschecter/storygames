Human Contact is a focus of Shock: about space anthropologists as they explore the many facets of personhood. The language system I'm working on is fundamentally about spoken language, and while the game encourages players to develop humanity at the very edges of imaginability, it doesn't even take into account deafness \u2014 which is certainly more common than, I dunno, having a separate set of vocal chords like cats do, so the speakers can make completely different sounds.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking about why I'm doing it this way, and I think it's because of the literary nature of science fiction. If you need a word, you'll make one that's pronounceable \u2014\xa0I'm more likely to find myself eating from the Yakir plant than the Hkgktptlcp, simply because I need to be able to pronounce it in my head and to other players.</p>\n<p>But that got me thinking about sign language. ASL is at most a distant cousin of English. How common is RPG play among deaf people? Are there deaf groups? Do they play with hearing friends? How do those groups deal with made up words?</p>\n<p>Are there any deaf Story Gameketeers who can point me to some good resources or at least give me some ideas? I've studied linguistics myself and have some <a href="http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/linguistics2.htm" rel="nofollow">basic knowledge</a>, but I'm curious about some personal experience.</p>\n<p>(Curiously, there's an entire gestural language in our current game that's used in battle when many people are in vacuum and radios are being jammed, and there's at least one rude gesture. But these are noncanonical systems we're using, and I don't know how to encourage their creation.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283603/#Comment_283603" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T21:19:03+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  9:19PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know any deaf or hearing-impaired roleplayers, but could post on a disability community I'm on to ask around.

In this case the hand signals weren't sign language, but adapted from traditional Indian dancing.

Tell you what, I'll poke around and do some research with your needs in mind and tell you what I find.<br/><br/>As far as the atomic signs of sign language, the sign itself is a phoneme. Here's an amateur analysis, noting that this is not really an area I am expert in (but I love helping so here's an attempt):<br/><br/>ME<br/>handshape: 1-hand<br/>location: chest<br/>movement: touch<br/>palm orientation: down<br/><br/>THINK<br/>handshape: 1-hand<br/>location: forehead<br/>movement: touch<br/>palm orientation: down<br/><br/>Those two signs differ only in the location features, which are elements of the phonemes. In English there there are two levels of phonological organization: the word (/b\u028ct/) and the segments that make up that word (/b/, /\u028c/, and /t/). In ASL, there is only one level of organization: the sign itself. So the features 1-hand, forehead, touch, and down correspond to the word/phoneme /THINK/.<br/><br/>I hope that helps or at least presents more questions. I'd love to help you get the answers you're looking for, even if I can't directly be of use. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283733/#Comment_283733" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T12:51:51+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 12:51PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2010 12:53PM by David Artman.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IANADP, but what I've seen of ASL, it seems to me to be akin to languages that use characters (e.g. zhongwen).<br/><br/>Etymologically, early zhongwen was somewhat like what we use as "universal symbols" today (e.g. <b>\u2642</b> for man), combined to form more complex concepts (like German can clump root words together ad infinitum). For example, "protection" is this character: \u4fdd. Looks a lot like a woman (\u4ebb\u4eba) holding her baby (\u5b50), no? (According to <a href="http://www.chineseetymology.org/CharacterASP/CharacterEtymology.aspx?characterInput=%E4%BF%9D" rel="nofollow">this guy</a>, it does.)<br/><br/>Similarly, our Roman alphabet is basically made up of shape drawings of mouth, tongue, and lip positions one does to make the phonemes (VERY roughly).<br/><br/>So I'd think the "gesturemes" of a gestural language could be made up of a sort of pantomime which would eventually develop its own shorthand (no pun intended) that might some day look nothing like the original (viz <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/chinese_evolution.htm" rel="nofollow">some Chinese characters' evolutions</a>).<br/><br/>So the short answer is: it really doesn't matter what you make your gesturemes, if you are far enough in the future after the development of the base language (the "mother tongue," so to speak). But if you want to make something "logical" and not too far evolved into shorthand, then look to gestures which you'd expect someone from another country to comprehend, were you to make them at/for that person today.<br/><br/>This is all assuming a typical humanoid with two hands, fiver fingers, etc. Start messing with the morphology of the speaker, and the "logical" morphology of the language will change to suit. After all... octopus "sign language" would have totally different gestures, and probably would have totally different terms that they consider root or fundamental--we might have a root gesture for "flat" that is actually a very complex, compound term for the amorphous octopus sign language.<br/><br/>Hope this helps, even if I Am Not A Deaf Person (you were wondering, weren't you?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I'm not sure how facial expressions get described yet. Finger positions are covered by handshape or classifiers, the latter of which tells you how to position your hands and how to move them. More detail to come.<br/><br/>Facial expressions also cover things like intonation in spoken English, from what I can tell. If you raise your eyebrows and tilt your head forward while signing, you're indicating a question.<br/><br/>If you do a google search for "ASL orthography" you'll see several cases of how the package all the information of a given sign into a neat little notation. Well, maybe not neat, but usable!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
