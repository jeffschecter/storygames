I don't know why exactly, but it's time to give in to my desire.<br/><br/>Mechanics/Resolution Hacks<br/><br/>1) The first hack is using "Say yes or roll dice" from DitV.  V:tr is chock full of "to do X roll these traits against these other traits" and while the section about the main resolution mechanics says the GM can ignore the need to roll dice at her whim, I would much rather have the resolution mechanic come up only when someone at the table has a "Oh no you fucking don't" moment.<br/><br/>2) Vitae (blood) from feeding on mortals is capped based on the intensity of the relationship you have with the victim.  A complete stranger will only ever give you a single Vitae, two if you kill them in the process of feeding.  An animal will only ever give you one Vitae.  If you have a relationship with the vessel, you'll be able to get more and more.  Whether that relationship is friendly or antagonistic, the Vampire will only get the most out of feeding if the vessel has a strong connection to the Vampire.<br/><br/>3) A Vampire can only suffer final death by Diablerie.  Even if it's body is completely destroyed by a nuclear blast, the vampire will eventually reconstitute itself.  If you want to destroy another Vampire for ever, you have to feed on them until there is absolutely nothing left-- their very essence is consumed and united with their assailant.  The main purpose of this house rule is to emphasize the "hell is other people" thematic statement that is often circumvented in V:tR by shooting people in the face.<br/><br/>4) Blood Potency caps Humanity.  Your Humanity + Blood Potency can never be more than 10.  If you want to be powerful in the ways of being monstrous, you're going to be messed up.  Furthermore, every derangement you suffer from Humanity loss immediately raises your Blood Potency by one.  If this causes further humanity loss, you don't check for derangement again.  So the fastest way to become a powerful vampire is to act monstrously.  And if you want the points that fuel your vampire powers (Vitae) you're going to have to feed off of those you have relationships with.<br/><br/>5) Keys from TSoY for XP.  A very, very common V:tR hack talked about in different places.  Basically it's there to ensure characterization.  The V:tR XP system is so bolted on after the fact that many GMs running the game just give arbitrary XP anyway.<br/><br/>Procedural Hacks<br/><br/>1) City Burning much like the first session of Burning Empires/Wheel or Mouseguard.  Or the city creation of Dresden Files.  Willow's excellent blog posts about it:<br/><a href="http://willowrants.wordpress.com/2006/11/05/burning-vampires/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://willowrants.wordpress.com/2006/11/05/burning-vampires/</a><br/><a href="http://willowrants.wordpress.com/2006/11/06/burning-vampires-part-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://willowrants.wordpress.com/2006/11/06/burning-vampires-part-ii/</a><br/><br/>2) Relationship creation as part of Character creation.  The whole point of Burning a city is to make an environment you interact with and since the relationships allow you to feed, they'll have to be explicitly stated.<br/><br/>3) Kicker creation after relationship creation.  Pretty much how it works in Sorcerer as the City Burning session and character creation will occur at the same session.  So everyone will have the same sort of collaborative self-propelling into action.  The main reason is that as the GM, I don't want to have "my story" whatsoever.<br/><br/>4) Explicit shared scene framing.  V:tR already has the scene as a mechanical unit of time.  So this dial is being turned up to 11 and scene framing rights will go to any participant who loses a conflict.  So if you get beaten down, out maneuvered or otherwise lose something you thought was worth fighting for, the next scene is framed by you.  If it's a NPC, then it's the GM's turn.  Times I've tried this before has led to a real victimization-revenge cycle.<br/><br/>Some of this needs to be fleshed out a bit more, but anyone have any thoughts or ideas so far?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320972/#Comment_320972" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T09:49:17+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  9:49AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmm, seems like it would work?

I think if there's no conflict, someone who wasn't involved in the last scene gets to frame the next one.

It also makes some of the negative sides of being a vampire slightly less worse.  For example, the lower your humanity, the more utterly helpless you are during the day.  A high humanity vampire can actual force themselves to awaken and operate outside of any direct or indirect daylight while a low humanity vampire is as dead as a corpse during the day.<br/><br/>Also, with the needing relationships with the feeding target (<b>see my restored original post</b>) to get anything other than a sustinence level of vitae, having a low humanity means that one is left with either terrorizing/stalking/abusing as the only way to reliably relate to mortals as one's humanity drops.  This also forces inhuman vampires towards feeding on their fellow Kindred to get Vitae at a reliable rate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320991/#Comment_320991" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T15:17:46+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  3:17PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside: Lots of people, when they write Keys, neglect writing a good buyoff.

I'm going to use all of those.<br/><br/>And good point about the buy off.<br/><br/>One thing I was hoping to create is a lot more vampire on vampire feeding.  In some of the best vampire books and movies, blood can be taken from other vampires and it's a very demeaning and violating process.  It's treating them like meat.<br/><br/>So when an older vampire comes out of decades of torpor and needs to feed, all his mortal relationships are likely long gone.  So if he wants Vitae, he's going to have to find the currently active Kindred and start blood-raping.  Or find new mortals to start terrorizing.  Or go on a killing spree and get only one or two Vitae per murder.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of removing the blood bond rules.  Or making that an act of will.  So you can't use your blood to gain control of someone feeding off of you when you're not willingly giving blood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320997/#Comment_320997" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T15:32:48+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  3:32PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good thought.

Perhaps it starts at 10 minus blood potency for everyone and if you use any supernatural power to harm/violate another, you have to make a check to see if it reduces or you get deranged.

The players need to be invested in playing their characters as real human beings, under pressure to do terrible things.

I think the "Vampire society" thing is mostly detrimental to the game, and the game gets better the fewer NPC vampires are in it.

I think I like the idea of supernaturally victimizing someone potentially making you better at being a supernatural predator (derangement gives you blood potency in my hack).  Perhaps I don't need a cap on social interactions with mortals, but I do also like the idea of reduced dice pools forcing inhuman vampires to either feed on other vampires or make an abusive/terrorizing relationship with a mortal.<br/><br/>But I see what you're getting at.  You want to free up any moral question for the group to answer rather than have it be codified in the system.  To let the moral questions grow in the fruitful void.<br/><br/>I'm going to think about this more and reread the morality/humanity/degeneration sections of the rulebooks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321011/#Comment_321011" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T17:16:24+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  5:16PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason why the Humanity system as written is good for morality-centered games is <i>because</i> players have no input in it.

Anyone can justify anything to anyone else if you give them enough time, or put them in a tight enough vise, and vampires in Requiem are in a ridiculous vise and have infinite time. The key to making the system work is to really read how you gain Humanity back after a loss. It's remorse and making amends, the latter drives the game forward.<br/><br/>This is also why in the oWoD, the Path of Whatever I Was Going To Do Anyway is both funny, and really something to avoid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321015/#Comment_321015" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T18:24:46+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  6:24PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2011 9:42PM by frozenwastes.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kind of looking for a humanity death spiral though. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>  Where if you wrong someone and then make amends, you're building the intensity of the relationship with them, making them prime candidates for feeding, which is a supernatural victimization of a mortal, which might cause degeneration...<br/><br/>In the humanity system as is, there are some problems with having a low humanity, but generally speaking, you can let it get really low before you have to worry about it.  The rules even say that most Kindred stabilize their humanity at around 4.  And they're right.  You can hang out pretty much forever at humanity three through five without giving any thought to ever going higher.<br/><br/>And if you do decide to go higher, system as is just encourages you to have the occasional contrived remorse/amends scene where you spend XP (you'd rather spend on stuff you'd actually want) just so you don't lose your character.<br/><br/>I know it's not <i>supposed </i>to be a contrived scene where you just spend some reward points to make a problem go away, but that's what the system actually does in play unless you really take the time to force it to be different.

I would much rather have Kickers (and bangs) and the seeking of hitting Keys drive play forward.<br/><br/>EDIT -- As for the Victorian fiction thing, you're right.  They often include a very objective take on morality and the 7 deadly sins and humanity/degeneration fits with that.  I guess I want a game more like vampire novels had they been written by Jean Paul Sartre in the late 1930s/early 40s.  The Wall or No Exit, but with vampires.<br/><br/>EDIT 2 -- That all said, if anyone has any ideas how to make the existing humanity rules work and work well (other than me as the GM insisting on people roleplaying a guilt scene to my satisfaction like the rules on p183 suggest) I'm all ears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321025/#Comment_321025" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T21:52:22+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  9:52PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dudes, keep talking.

That's an interesting question. To me it has never been perfunctory. It doesn't appear like it was supposed to be.</blockquote>\nIt's not supposed to be perfunctory.  But the procedure spelled out on page 183-184 of V:tr is pretty weak.  The player announces her desire to buy Humanity and the GM assesses the character recent actions in terms of their morality and says yes or no to the request.<br/><br/>What I was talking about earlier (on page 183) is what the player does when they find out about the humanity loss.  How they react to that is then assessed to determine what penalty or bonus they get on a roll to avoid getting a derangement.  So this one is more of the perfunctory one.  Where you basically need to go through the motions and say the right things and you're supposed to get a bonus.  In some games, I bet you could even use the sample quotes on p183 as ritual phrases and get a bonus.<br/><br/>Another issue I have, and this is definitely connected with the Victorian take on morality and derangement is that moral failure is linked to mental health problems explicitly in the rules.  I find "mental health problems are caused by immorality" to be distastefully prejudicial towards those facing mental health issues.  So I need to rework Derangements as well to be something else entirely.  Like mandatory key replacements with keys rewarding further inhumanity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321040/#Comment_321040" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T23:41:00+00:00" title="April 17, 2011 11:41PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>Cool.Next question: do you in any way address the exponential XP cost in the WoD games?

Keys generally will produce way more XP than the normal rules, so the costs would likely need to be adjusted based on how fast you want power increases.<br/><br/>One of the issues is that the value of different disciplines at different dots is wildly subject to what types of situations occur in play.  Given that I want to have explicit player scene framing, this will be less of an issue.  But imagine if someone spent points on the Cruac ritual that makes your blood poison in a game where the odds of being fed upon are super low.  On the other hand, I'm planning on dialing up inter-vampire feeding and such blood magic suddenly becomes more valuable.<br/><br/>For example, is the Auspex 3 ability to get psychic impressions from objects really worth 50% more XP than the Auspex 2 ability to see auras?<br/><br/>I guess it comes down to whether or not you want vampires that are more likely to specialize or generalize.

Now in Sorcerer you would roll it against itself.   So you could do an opposed roll, Humanity vs. Itself.  Best number of successes wins.  If the player wins, humanity doesn't degrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the opposite should be true also.  If the Vampire does something worthy of humanity gain (shows real compassion, selflessness... however your group defines what humanity is.)  Then the same roll is made.  This time if the player wins, a point of humanity is gained.  If he looses, then nothing changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n(One of the things that bothered me about vampire is that humanity gain was put entirely in the hands of the GM while humanity loss was mechanical.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here's the important part.  The level of humanity has NOTHING to do with how 'human' the vampire is. It doesn't dictate their behavior or choices of action. What it does is measure how close they are to going over the edge and loosing it. Once humanity hits zero, the vampire goes over the edge.  Inhuman vampires have lost it already.  Humanity is a binary condition, either you have it or you don't.<br/>\n<br/>\nA vampire that has completely lost its humanity becomes an NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt worked for us anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321091/#Comment_321091" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T11:19:21+00:00" title="April 18, 2011 11:19AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 12:21PM by frozenwastes.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never been satisfied with a character being taken away from one participant and given to another when a number on a sheet reaches a certain point.

As you victimize these mortals in supernatural ways, you're more and more likely to have increases in blood potency and gain vampric degeneration key lines like "3 XP: Every time you commit diablerie" or "1 XP: Every time you create a ghoul."<br/><br/>When you hit BP 7, you're now on a Vampire Vitae diet.  Your relationships with mortals to feed off of them become irrelevant pretty quickly and you become a predator of vampires rather than mortals.  And also, the reduced humanity capping social interaction dice pools means that your ability to relate to mortals is vastly diminished.  Here, blood potency gain and humanity loss will be very, very slow unless the player actively chooses to victimize mortals in supernatural ways anyway.  If someone hits BP7, the game is likely going to shift rather dramatically as someone at the table is going to be feeding off of Kindred now.<br/><br/>I think it's at this point that things will start shifting towards the telling of their exit story as a PC.  They're either going to have to pull themselves out of Kindred society and go into Torpor, embrace their inhumanity and become the predator of predators, or fight their way back up the humanity scale.*<br/><br/>My whole hack of the game assumes that there are not that many NPC vampires and certainly not a Camirilla like global vampire super government.  Everything is local or regional and the ratio to PCs to NPCs will probably be along the lines of In A Wicked Age.<br/><br/>* - I have no idea about how to handle regaining humanity in my rules hack and whether or not it should even be an option.

I agree that it makes sense to include some narration or even have a final scene as part of the character being retired from PC status, but either way you are "losing" your character in the sense that the character is no longer a PC. But it's not like books with these sort of rules are like 'the very moment it reaches zero the GM should leap up from the table and physically grab the PC's character sheet away from the player!'

That the player has an opportunity to narrate the denouement or even some sort of epilogue for their character does not actually change the fact that the character is no longer part of the game as a PC.<br/></blockquote>\nVery true that a short epilogue narration doesn't change the fact that the character is being removed as a PC.  But an organic process that ushers in the end of a character's story is very different than failing a die check, having a number reach 0 and then narrating for a minute (often less) about what happened.<br/><br/>In the World of Darkness games by White Wolf, you'll find:<br/><br/>"If a character descends so far that her Morality drops to zero, she can no longer be played in any meaningful way. She becomes a true monster, inflicting pain and suffering on everyone around her without the slightest hint of remorse and no hope of redemption. At that point control of the character passes to the Storyteller."<br/><br/>So yeah, if you hit 0, you do immediately lose your character and the GM is now expected to run it.<br/><br/>The text of Vampire: The Requiem expounds on this, describing the state of mind of vampires at different humanity levels.  It describes low humanity vampires as being irrational, ridden with derangements and utterly inhuman and Humanity 0 vampires as being in a perpetual state of frenzy.  But if you go through the normal process of lowering your humanity from 7 to 1 or 2, you're not going to end up with that many derangements.  The text says "a vampire with a stat of X, acts like Y" but then does nothing to help make that happen.  And then boom, you hit 0 and your character goes into endless frenzy.<br/><br/>Things like that are a good reason to take a look at Sorcerer (as you suggested) but I don't think that goes far enough.  For the purpose of this hack, I don't want what is effectively character death to be the result of losing humanity.  The result of losing humanity should be a greater and greater characterization of monstrous behavior and victimization of those around you.<br/><br/>Also, I probably should have covered this earlier, but my principle goal is not to produce big model "Story Now!" theme/morality play with V:tr.  The purpose of many of these hacks is to get the genre of vampire fiction in play.  It's still very much (in big model terms) a "right to dream" approach.  I actually find most techniques that people talk about as being about exploring thematic statements to work better at simulating the type of thematic statements found in fiction of that genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321135/#Comment_321135" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T17:14:24+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  5:14PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 5:15PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: frozenwastes</cite>Things like that are a good reason to take a look at Sorcerer (as you suggested) but I don't think that goes far enough.

I was specifically commenting on how things worked in traditional Sorcerer play, and therefore why the game works that way. Implicit to that is the possibility that you want your game to do something else. The focus of Sorcerer is Humanity, that doesn't mean it has to be the focus of your Vampire hack.<br/><br/>That said I think your characterization of the rules, even for Vampire, as being some kind of sudden, purely-mechanical thing is pretty uncharitable to our hypothetical players in this situation. It's not like you drop to 0 Humanity in a single session. There is a long history of character behaviour in play that has brought the character to this point, and everybody involved is aware what that point 'means' in terms of character control, etc. If someone rapidly accelerates their character's Humanity loss through a series of increasingly monstrous actions, that <i>is</i> "an organic process that ushers in the end of a character's story." They didn't do it by accident, like 'whoops oh I thought my character was still pretty nice.' Whether or not it is the ideal way of modeling that process or not is another thing, but at least in Sorcerer (and to a lesser degree in Vampire) these are not sterile, officious mechanics with no relation to character activity. They are the result of the character's actions, over which the player had direct control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321144/#Comment_321144" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T18:11:11+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  6:11PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=23067.0" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a thread on the Forge about the difference between (old) Vampire's humanity system, and Sorcerer's.

Hunter introduced the idea of tiers of play to WoD games and the Vampire product Danse Macabre brings them to Vampire).  Tier 1 is local level play centred on the struggle between humanity and the beast.  Tier 2 is about vampire society and politics.  Tier 3 is about global conspiracy and large metaplots.  For someone who wants to play a game on a different tier of play than Tier 1, the humanity rules end up being rules for what the game is not about.  Or at the most, is setting/genre colour.<br/><br/>Many V:tr games are squarely in tier 2 and the players only concern themselves with humanity insofar as to prevent it from getting in the way of what they want to do.  Danse Macabre even suggests alternate rules and scrapping the humanity mechanics for such play.<br/><br/>But for a tier 1 game that is specifically focused on it, the humanity system could provide a framework on which to hang narration and scene framing to tell the story of a vampire struggling between humanity and the beast in a 19th century moral framework transplanted into the 21st century.<br/><br/>The issue with V:tr is the objective defining of good and sin.  As you pointed out, it's very much a result of the early vampire fiction being in Victorian novels.  And when you be immoral, you somehow develop specific mental health diagnoses.  As if immorality causes mental disorders.  As if mental disorders are a sign of someone being less than human.<br/><br/>The players are given a blurb about how a vampire at each humanity level acts.  They'll occasionally get a derangement or two as they decline, but with very little mechanical support for having the derangement (again, another blurb about how they should act and maybe a penalty to a skill).  This is only really going to work for someone who's goal approaching the game is to play the humanity loss and derangement as their main goal of play.  If you want to do anything else, it's just an easily ignorable distraction.  It takes a lot of work and screen time to make the existing humanity rules do what they say they will on the box.<br/><br/>Basically I think rules that say "you feel this way now" or "you have this mental illness now" suck.  I'd much, much rather have something encourage the characterization of the visible effects of those conditions instead.  Keys from TSoY are marvelous for this.<br/><br/>So what I mean by organic is that the reward cycle encourages behaviour that demonstrates the growing monstrosity rather than mechanics that prescribe it by saying "act this way now" and doing nothing else to support it other than to exhort the GM to police the players on the matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321151/#Comment_321151" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T18:25:33+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  6:25PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 6:28PM by frozenwastes.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=23067.0" rel="nofollow">Here</a>is a thread on the Forge about the difference between (old) Vampire's humanity system, and Sorcerer's.

I especially liked:\n<blockquote><cite>Simon C wrote, in the thread linked above</cite><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that stats that overtly define the status of a character with regards to important thematic elements in the game can be a really effective way of ensuring that that theme has absolutely no emotional impact on the players</blockquote>\nAnother reason why I've decoupled humanity from any other act than supernaturally victimizing a mortal.  Yes, your humanity/blood potency will be a overtly defined status, but the end result of it will be the gaining of a reward mechanic that encourages being monstrous.  And by that I mean specific acts that violate others.  Humanity 4/Blood Potency 6 doesn't mean "you should act like X" the way the V:tR describes each humanity level.  It simply produces a source of XP and limits your ability to positively relate to mortals, forcing you ever closer to feeding your own kind.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that if a player decides to hammer their humanity down, that it will produce an experience where they start out seeing humans as their food source but as needing to relate to them as people in order to effectively feed off of them.  That will get harder and harder and the "us" vs "them" of it will grow and grow as it becomes easier to form abusive relationships rather than healthy ones.  Then they'll eventually hit a point where the "us" they've had all along (other vampires) suddenly becomes equated to the "them" of food source.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321153/#Comment_321153" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T18:53:27+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  6:53PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Willpower: We always forgot about it, and didn't use it.

It certainly proceeds more organically, as you say, but I assume that you consider the process fairly settled, and that if your mechanics failed to produce this progression you would be disappointed? It seems to me that you have adopted the basic idea of V:tR -- that 'a vampire with Humanity X should act like Y' and simply refined the implementation so that the character is encouraged to do so via mechanical incentives rather than via a vague sense that this is how the book says it should happen. These incentives are more specific but the basic judgment is still: as you become inhuman, it is increasingly rewarding to act in further-inhuman ways. This is an incentive-based 'death spiral' (much softer than a punitive death spiral), which can be contrasted with Sorcerer (no particular difference no matter what your Humanity score is) and Vampire (it is harder to lose Humanity the lower it gets, because fewer actions trigger rolls. This encourages inhuman action but not Humanity loss.)<br/><br/>This doesn't really matter if your game is not particularly about this descent, or is instead I suppose about seeing how characters will react to these effects. That seems to be the case, but as you point out the effects of Humanity loss as you describe them are pretty far-reaching, particularly if it is not recoverable. The exchange of Key XP lines with the Inhumanity XP lines are irreversible, which produces some weird incentives, mechanically, even if you ignore the incentive to perform monstrous deeds (buying off a 'tainted' Key becomes more attractive, for example, allowing you to buy new Keys that have an un-fragmented list of XP gains. So Humanity loss in theory leads to accelerated changes in character arcs/morality/personality.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321162/#Comment_321162" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T20:03:33+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  8:03PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>It seems to me that you have adopted the basic idea of V:tR -- that 'a vampire with Humanity X should act like Y' and simply refined the implementation so that the character is encouraged to do so via mechanical incentives rather than via a vague sense that this is how the book says it should happen.</blockquote>\nYes.  Exactly.  But maybe it's a bad idea.  See below for more.<br/><br/>(Also, I'm changing what the value of Y is.  In V:tR, Y = mental illness caused by immorality.)\n<blockquote> These incentives are more specific but the basic judgment is still: as you become inhuman, it is increasingly rewarding to act in further-inhuman ways.

What if it didn't replace the experience line of another Key, but just added more and more to the Vampric Degeneration Key?  That might shift things more towards the player choosing how little or not they engage with the Key.  As it is, becoming more and more monstrous would indeed cause personality shifts, the altering of character arcs and the changing of personality.<br/><br/>However, if you could only choose from a limited set of Keys and once you lost a line from a key, you could never get it back and once you abandon a Key, you can't take it again, eventually, you're only going to have Vampric Degeneration as your Key.  At that point, the only way to get XP will be to do very specific horrible things.  You'll have a big menu to choose from though.<br/><br/>I'm undecided about this.  <br/><br/>Maybe I should scrap Humanity as a stat, have Vampric Degeneration get added to when you go up in Blood Potency by getting enough successes on a BP pool roll after you have a scene in which you victimize a mortal in a supernatural way.  And leave the player chosen Keys intact.  No cap on social skills as old vampires are often beautiful and charming in Vampire fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321167/#Comment_321167" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T20:18:02+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  8:18PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing you could do is make some extra, mandatory Keys:<br/><br/>Key of the Vampire:<br/>1 XP: Feed on someone<br/>2 XP: Feed on someone close to you<br/>5 XP: Kill someone close to you by feeding on them<br/>Buyoff: Find a way to overcome your hunger<br/><br/>Key of the Monster:<br/>1 XP: Frighten someone.<br/>2 XP: Hurt someone.<br/>5 XP: Harm someone who cares about you.<br/>Buyoff: Fall in love.<br/><br/>Key of the Elder:<br/>1 XP: Feed on another Vampire<br/>2 XP: Feed on another Vampire who looks up to you<br/>5 XP: Commit Diablerie<br/>Buyoff: Find a way to restore your humanity<br/><br/>Carrots, not sticks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321168/#Comment_321168" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T20:20:49+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  8:20PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2011 12:25AM by frozenwastes.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I might have just been convinced to adopt Sorcerer's approach of never limiting the functional choices you can make during play by having your humanity go down.<br/><br/>I think I will have the Key of Vampric Derangement get more and more XP lines, but not have humanity cap social dice pools with mortals (so that's another V:tR rule tossed), and not have player chosen keys get diminished.<br/><br/>EDIT:  So if a player wants to emphasize the vampric side of things, they can pick those three Keys Simon C just mentioned.

The only thing I don't like is the whole losing your character to another player at the table thing.  I think I'd rather have it be that you lose all your keys but your damnation keys and can then only get experience by being a totally damned monster.  Maybe the final Key of Damnation will be pretty horrific.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

My only problem is still the overall hierarchy of sins. If you're still on the first key of damnation, the sins listed on the higher keys don't affect you. It's not cool to feed on a human with the first key, for example, but you can murder the motherf'er because murder would be in the second key of damnation, not the first.<br/><br/>Maybe the keys should collapse somehow. The first key of damnation has all the sins on the hierarchy, and the second key has fewer, the third key fewer still, and when you buyoff the third key you lose all of your non-damnation keys, gain the "Final Key of Damnation" which gives you XP for being a monstrous motherfucker, and can only buy new keys from a specific "Damnation" set (which, if your game was like that, could include Keys of Redemption!) that would give you XP for getting your damnation on (that is, reveling in it).<br/><br/>Do you lot see my problem and the reason for my solution?

I'm not particularly interested in that angle is what I meant, I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378800/#Comment_378800" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T14:08:22+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  2:08PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An update:<br/><br/>It's been a year and I've played two mini-series of this hack.<br/><br/>In the first series, it started when a vampire got an XP line for their Key Vampric Degeneration that gave them an XP for every time they fed off of a mortal another vampire has a relationship with.  The player chose the 14 year old daughter of another PC, who was a recently turned vampire as their primary target.  The player took almost every opportunity they could to have a scene where she could simultaneously get XP for hurting the girl and her character's other keys.  The other players started framing scenes to counter her vampire's attacks both in the short and long term.  Including preparing a burial site, chains and a lot of cement to put the attacker down.  It did end with the vampire being chained up and buried alive with wet cement.  But not without first implanting in the girl's mind that the love of her life was trapped beneath the concrete and that she must free him in five years (his player saw his demise coming and she made preparations accordingly).<br/><br/>The second series was a continuation of the first and started with the girl jack-hammering the concrete away.  The vampire she freed immediately voluntarily frenzied, fed on her and killed her.  Characters had been modified a bit (it was 5 years) and pretty much everyone had geared up for serious player-vs-player play.  They all degenerated very quickly as they went after each other's mortal friends and family.  It was like they all decided that the antagonist from the first series was the most fun and all went for it.  The antagonist vampire from the first series ended up pretending to have kidnapped the girl and claimed he was holding her as a hostage to keep her mother at bay while he reestablished himself and made alliances with the rapidly degenerating vampires.  The series ended with the vampire mother of the child finding her corpse and discovering she was dead all along.<br/><br/>I've since come to the conclusion that nothing about the play that we enjoyed came from the rules set I started with (Vampire: The Requiem) other than some of the setting elements.  Pretty much any task or conflict resolution system could have worked just fine.  So it looks like the next time I run this, I'll probably go with Strands of Fate + Keys rather than a V:tR hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14150/feedback-help-with-a-vampire-the-requiem-hack" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14150/feedback-help-with-a-vampire-the-requiem-hack" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14150/feedback-help-with-a-vampire-the-requiem-hack/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14150%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14150%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
