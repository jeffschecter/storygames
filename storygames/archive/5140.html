My obvious fumbling was kindly overlooked by my co-players and I came away with a real desire to learn more about the why and how of the session.<br/><br/>While I have GM\u2019d sessions of Burning Wheel and Inspectres, I certainly don\u2019t feel that I was able to really hit the \u2018story-now\u2019 nail on the head, and to actually play outside the story-before box was enlightening and I feel will provide a valuable lesson for the next time my BW group comes together.<br/><br/>This is where this rambling monologue comes in. My current (non-BW) group, for whom I have run a 4-session BW, Inspectres and Dead of Night games \u2013 to mixed results \u2013 firmly refuse to move away from their story-before D20 comfort zones. Their response to such games as Cold City, TSOY or Conspiracy of Shadows is that they \u201care far too complicated\u201d and that they aren\u2019t D20.<br/><br/>While I really enjoy the company of the chaps I game with, I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the endless dungeon crawls or the, effectively, non-interactive sessions I am participating in. However, if I can\u2019t convince the gang to play some of the new and very exciting games out their, then part of me is starting to think that if I can\u2019t beat them I should join them\u2026<br/><br/>So, is it possible to do story-now with D20? Can such a system which rewards purely combat based on task resolution do story-now, or am I stuck in an endless cycle of story-before dungeoneering?  I have tried searching the Story-games forum for such topics, but can only find discussions related to general story-gaming which doesn't seem to quite scratch the itch.<br/><br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116032/#Comment_116032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-22T14:00:39+00:00" title="December 22, 2007  2:00PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A compromise might be to try appending some cool stuff onto your current game. <br/><br/>The <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/experience.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet 20 </a>experience system  adds the Keys from TSOY onto your D20 characters without chaging anything else.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.wicked-dead.com/thirty/Fraternitas.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fraternitas</a> Is a system which allows you to add some cool help/screw your comrad motivations into the mix.<br/><br/>And to help round out thinking about what you are doing, Vincent wrote <a href="http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">some real great little essays</a> a while back which help to put this stuff into perspective.

All the others in the group are frustrated at the lack of such affinity and I've been trying to say that it may be more an issue of a lack of collaborative story construction which is resulting in this frustration, but I think the guys are too busy arguing that they simply need to play <i>more</i> rather than <i>differently</i>. Therefore, I think they do see that a problem exists, but they seem to have a real mental block with how to move toward a solution.<br>John                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116041/#Comment_116041" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-22T14:45:21+00:00" title="December 22, 2007  2:45PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>I have two regular games right now: my open-invite story-games night, and a close-friends D&amp;D game.

You can Address Premise or get your Story Now only so long with those rules before your players are leveling up and begin itching to try out their new feats and abilities on some monster ass. Then you're back to Gamist play. That's the beauty and power of the 3E rules. Don't fight it; embrace it.

The financial and temporal commitment to D20 (they keep turning up with armfulls of supplements each week) may be a huge factor in this issue. As for simple and fast games? I keep trying, and will continue to do so, but you then get the converse argument that they're too simple and not really a game. Again, I am left confused and frustrated. As for the whole affinity argument, the only change they want to bring about is playing the game more (as in for more sessions), rather than changing anything else.<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116061/#Comment_116061" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-22T23:49:05+00:00" title="December 22, 2007 11:49PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>It looks like you've discovered that you like a certain kind of game and you're dissatisfied with your current game.

You can Address Premise or get your Story Now only so long with those rules before your players are leveling up and begin itching to try out their new feats and abilities on some monster ass.

So yes, absolutely you can do Story Now with d20, even unaltered.<br/><br/>I once ran a d20 one-shot Star Wars game that had this setup.  The scenario took place between Episode 3 and 4.  Two surviving Jedi, an old republic diplomat, and a couple of droids are sent out to a planet to rescue another surviving Jedi.<br/><br/>Key Components of the Scenario.<br/><br/>1) The Empire has beat them there and has setup blockades and scout teams but are holding back for the arrival of Lord Vader.<br/>2) On the planet is a matriarchal tribe of force users who oppress their men because they think they are strong in the dark side.<br/>3) The surviving Jedi in question has taken advantage of this gender rift to start a "liberation" movement among the men.  In doing so he has set himself up as a Heart of Darkness style leader over these people.  He believes he is training the new Jedi Order.<br/>4) The matriarchs are more or less right in that the men of their tribe do channel the dark side easier than the light side.  The has tempted the surviving Jedi to take advantage of this fact to empower his army.  The Jedi is very close to going over to the dark side himself.<br/>5) The Jedi knows the Empire has found him and he relishes testing his new army against Lord Vader.<br/><br/>Do you see the issues here?  What do the players do about the Jedi?  Save him?  Call him a lost cause?  Side with him?  What if anything do the players do about the gender issues in the now divided tribe?  What impact does the Imperial presence have on the situation?<br/><br/>As long as you simply play the whole thing straight and honestly d20 will do just fine.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116276/#Comment_116276" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-25T16:09:30+00:00" title="December 25, 2007  4:09PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's a great campaign idea!<br/>-George                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116300/#Comment_116300" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T08:22:51+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  8:22AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been adding story game elements to my D&amp;D 3.5 game for some time now, with some good results.<br/><br/>Whenever we're not on the battlemap, I try to keep things moving narratively.  Each PC has a story-arc that I've worked out with the player.  I've let my players pick "aspects" for their characters (like in Spirit of the Century).  The aspects have no game mechanics, but they're a good short description of the various plots revolving around the characters.  Before each session, I ask the players which aspect they'd like to emphasize in the next game.<br/><br/>So, the game is very narrativist off the battlemat, and very d20 when a fight breaks out.

It gets everyone focused and let's them do all the "fighting stuff" right off the bat.  You have to find the right balance of fighting and story for your group.  It takes some work.<br/><br/>Second, realize that not every player is going to want to do heavy-duty roleplay.  If they don't want to do it, don't force it on them.  Just work extra hard on giving them moments to shine in combat.<br/><br/>Third, and this is something I picked up from listening to podcasts about improvisation and gaming, say YES to the players.  If they want to do something, let them do it, or at least find a good compromise.<br/><br/>Here's an example.  I'm currently running a game set in Monte Cook's Ptolus setting.  One of my players said, "I want to play an evil Orc Duskblade."  (Almost every group has a player who likes to play the odd characters) Now, Duskblade is a class that combine spell-casting and fighting, and it was supposedly developed by the elves (ancient enemies of the orcs).  I said YES, and we worked out a story where a Elven Duskblade Master made a foolish bet that left him training an orc in the arts of the Duskblade.  One of the other PCs was a fellow student.  There are story hooks right there.<br/><br/>Later, the same player said, "I want to multiclass with the Crusader (a class from Tome of Battle, a very experimental supplement.)"  I said, Sure thing.  And even later "I want to take this Jade Phoenix Mage prestige class from the ToB."  I looked at the JPM.  Its basic schtick is that there are 13 JPM in the world who keep reincarnating to prevent some great evil from breaking free of its prison.  The player and I talk about this, discussing options like the JPMs are all elves, usually, and the PC was reincarnated as an orc this time (and the other JPMs might want to fix the "mistake.")  Or the PC was a traitorous JPM that the others hunt down and kill every lifetime and was reincarnated this time.  Eventually, we changed the JPMs into an evil organization, dedicated to REVIVING an ancient evil.<br/><br/>OK, so, the player wants into an evil prestige class.  As part of the roleplay, I have an older JPM show up, and offer to "awaken your ancient memories."  The PC agrees.  The JPM tells him that, as part of his initiation, he must kill the NPC girlfriend of another PC.  The player agrees to this as well.  We do it all, right there in front of the others, who are watching in amazement as the PC lures the girlfriend into an alley with an illusion and carves her heart out.<br/><br/>Now, you might think that this would cause problems with the group, but because we did it all above the board, with the consent of all the players, it's really added something to the game.  Every now and then, the players talk about how cool it's going to be when their players learn of what the one player did.  And that player is just as happy as can be that he got to do what he wanted.  He says it's the best game he's ever been in (and he's notoriously hard to please.)<br/><br/>So, the corollary to saying YES is to make sure that everyone agrees to an action before it goes forward.  Talk it out.  Another part of saying YES in D&amp;D for me is to poll my players about what they'd like to do in the next session, with the agreement that they'll do that and not change their mind at the last second.  It lets me still plan out things in advance, while letting the players still have the freedom to choose what they want to do.  Cuts down on railroading and wasted planning time.<br/><br/>Let's see, what else...?  I've stolen several ideas from indie RPGs.  We have "fan mail" (taken from Prime Time Adventures) where the players can give each other poker chips whenever they do something "cool."  The chips can later be used to get an extra 1d6 to add to a d20 roll.  I find this acts as a positive feedback loop, with the players constantly trying to find "cool" things to do to earn chips from the other players.<br/><br/>I also took the idea of "aspects" from Spirit of the Century.  In my game, they are a list of small phrases that describe the various "sub-plots" that surround a character.  For instance, the evil PC I described up above has the following aspects:<br/><br/>Phoenix Mage<br/>The Black Knight (Arena fighting title)<br/>Enemy: Snew<br/>Chosen One of Ochremeshk<br/>"There's no problem 1,000 orcs can't solve!"<br/>Murderer of Yori<br/>In Debt to the Balacazar Crime Family<br/><br/>So, for each session, he can pick one aspect that I will do my best to work into the story of that session.<br/><br/>Well, that's about all I can think of right now... hope this helps a little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116778/#Comment_116778" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T07:23:41+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  7:23AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>I'd love to be wrong about D&amp;D 3e and Nar play.

You are SO screwed!"<br/>"My Longsword skill just went up!  I'm B6 now. Yay!"<br/>"A grey shade sword?!  Kick ass!"<br/>"New spell!  New spell!  I got a new spell!"<br/><br/>None of those indicate the group is playing anything but Nar.  They're just enjoying the crunchy bits of the system while doing so.  And those statements aren't significantly different from...<br/><br/>"Yeah!  I flanked your ass.  Eat my Sneak Attack!"   <br/>"Woot!  I'm 15th level now.  I am a god with a sword!"<br/>"A +3 Holy Flaming Longsword?!  Kick ass!"<br/>"I just learned Whirlwind Attack!"<br/><br/>And these guys might be playing a very Gamist game.  My point being that just because a game has lots of tactical bits and/or fighty parts, doesn't really indicate that it supports one CA over another to any significant degree.<br/><br/>Just sayin.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116791/#Comment_116791" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T08:36:33+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  8:36AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeffrey: Kudos!

So yes, absolutely you can do Story Now with d20, even unaltered.</blockquote>\nHi Jesse,<br/>While we have been addressing Premise, in the classic pre-generated dungeon-crawl "Go kill Big Bad who lives in X and is threatening Y" there is no emotional buy-in by the players and there characters. Those attempts to introduce the emotion of why we're risking all to go kill big bad....have generally fallen flat. I do think we can address the issues you've raised though if we went at in a more structured manner during face-to-face character generation. At the moment all character generation is undertaken 'solo' at home away from the group. We then jump straight in without such basic considerations as why we're together etc. It has been disappointing as the question keeps arising and has led to tension within the group. This is something I've done in BW character generation and it's helping in that game tremendously.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I once ran a d20 one-shot Star Wars game that had this setup.  The scenario took place between Episode 3 and 4.  Two surviving Jedi, an old republic diplomat, and a couple of droids are sent out to a planet to rescue another surviving Jedi.<br/><br/>Key Components of the Scenario.<br/><br/>1) The Empire has beat them there and has setup blockades and scout teams but are holding back for the arrival of Lord Vader.<br/>2) On the planet is a matriarchal tribe of force users who oppress their men because they think they are strong in the dark side.<br/>3) The surviving Jedi in question has taken advantage of this gender rift to start a "liberation" movement among the men.  In doing so he has set himself up as a Heart of Darkness style leader over these people.  He believes he is training the new Jedi Order.<br/>4) The matriarchs are more or less right in that the men of their tribe do channel the dark side easier than the light side.  The has tempted the surviving Jedi to take advantage of this fact to empower his army.  The Jedi is very close to going over to the dark side himself.<br/>5) The Jedi knows the Empire has found him and he relishes testing his new army against Lord Vader.<br/><br/>Do you see the issues here?  What do the players do about the Jedi?  Save him?  Call him a lost cause?  Side with him?  What if anything do the players do about the gender issues in the now divided tribe?  What impact does the Imperial presence have on the situation?<br/><br/>As long as you simply play the whole thing straight and honestly d20 will do just fine.<br/><br/>Jesse</blockquote>\nUnless you object, I'm going to steal this and try and get the guys interested with D20 Saga edition Star Wars.

It gets everyone focused and let's them do all the "fighting stuff" right off the bat.  You have to find the right balance of fighting and story for your group.  It takes some work.<br/><br/>Second, realize that not every player is going to want to do heavy-duty roleplay.  If they don't want to do it, don't force it on them.  Just work extra hard on giving them moments to shine in combat.<br/><br/>Third, and this is something I picked up from listening to podcasts about improvisation and gaming, say YES to the players.  If they want to do something, let them do it, or at least find a good compromise.</blockquote>\nNone of those point to Nar play at all, in my mind. They could be elements of Nar play or Gam play or anything else.\n<blockquote>Here's an example.  I'm currently running a game set in Monte Cook's Ptolus setting.  One of my players said, "I want to play an evil Orc Duskblade."  (Almost every group has a player who likes to play the odd characters) Now, Duskblade is a class that combine spell-casting and fighting, and it was supposedly developed by the elves (ancient enemies of the orcs).  I said YES, and we worked out a story where a Elven Duskblade Master made a foolish bet that left him training an orc in the arts of the Duskblade.  One of the other PCs was a fellow student.  There are story hooks right there.</blockquote>\nHold on a sec. When you say the "story hooks right there" thing, are you saying that supports "Story Now"? Because Ron's "Story Now" (and Narrativism, the way I understand it) isn't really about story hooks. It's about players focusing play on making thematic (usually moral) choices that matter to them. It's about addressing a premise.<br/><br/>Now this part might indicate some Narrativist thing happening, but I'm not sure:\n<blockquote>OK, so, the player wants into an evil prestige class.  As part of the roleplay, I have an older JPM show up, and offer to "awaken your ancient memories."  The PC agrees.  The JPM tells him that, as part of his initiation, he must kill the NPC girlfriend of another PC.  The player agrees to this as well.  We do it all, right there in front of the others, who are watching in amazement as the PC lures the girlfriend into an alley with an illusion and carves her heart out.<br/><br/>Now, you might think that this would cause problems with the group, but because we did it all above the board, with the consent of all the players, it's really added something to the game.  Every now and then, the players talk about how cool it's going to be when their players learn of what the one player did.  And that player is just as happy as can be that he got to do what he wanted.  He says it's the best game he's ever been in (and he's notoriously hard to please.)</blockquote>\nWhen you offered the choice to the player (kill the girlfriend or don't be a Jade Phoenix Mage), was it conceivable in your mind that the player would choose the latter? Worded another way, would you have offered an initiation task that a player might have refused -- that it was uncertain if the player would accept it? Were you pretty sure the player would accept the initiation task because a) you knew the player's preferences pretty well, or b) there was some kind of quick negotiation at the table that you're not talking about in your example?<br/><br/>What if you<i> had </i>given a task the player "couldn't" (refused to) do? Let's say you said, "In order to be a Jade Phoenix Mage, you must kill Bob" and Bob is another player's character and the JPM and Bob are supposed to be trusted friends. Let's say JPM's player decides that's too much. Would that have been a "fair play" by you as DM or would that have been out-of-bounds? Might the player have said, "You're unfairly blocking me from taking that prestige class?" Or maybe the player would have figured you had DM power that let you say no to a given prestige class but would wonder why you didn't just say no instead of giving him this "false choice"?<br/><br/>Really, I don't know which you're saying is the case. I'm just throwing out some scenarios and asking you to tell me what you think is most likely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117127/#Comment_117127" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T14:53:23+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  2:53PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite><br/>Nothing about fighting, leveling up, or getting new feats and abilities points to either Narrativist or Gamist play.

I believe, however, that reveling in competitive play as the main feature of play suggests a pretty Gamist agenda. That's what I was seeing from my players, despite an earlier agreement about playing a game that explored issues of responsibility. The characters were princes and princesses, all struggling to find their way under a drunkard father-king in a small kingdom beset with problems. Play started off pretty Narrativist, with all kinds of address-of-premise stuff involving who had real authority to run the kingdom and make decisions with dad drunk and passed-out, and if they should hide it from outsiders, or the staff, or the queen. Before I knew it, though, there were monsters and combats that weren't really addressing any premise but were certainly good for XP. And the players seemed more interested in how the next level's abilities would help them win more meaningless fights than how they'd help them face their responsibilities.<br/><br/>In short, the game had drifted from Nar to Gam. (Then a crucial player moved to another city and we stopped meeting.)\n<blockquote>And these guys might be playing a very Gamist game.  My point being that just because a game has lots of tactical bits and/or fighty parts, doesn't really indicate that it supports one CA over another to any significant degree.</blockquote>\nNot necessarily, but if you were going to design a game that did support a Gamist CA, you'd want to put in stuff that let players compete, that helped a player measure success in winning, and that had clear spoils for the winners. My point is that D&amp;D 3E does that stuff really well. In fact, I think it does it so well that it's hard to drift the game away from that.<br/><br/>I say that our game drifted Nar to Gam, but the truth is that I took a game that was wired for Gam and drifted it to Nar. I bolted on a <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/index.php/Character_Bonds_%28D20%29" rel="nofollow">Character Bonds</a> XP system that rewarded characters for the choices they made about things they said they cared about. It was my attempt at a Nar hook. But it wasn't enough, and it fed XP to the players and mostly they used that XP to fuel Gamist play.

This assumes though, that your players don't just see everything as a walking form of XP waiting to be converted through violence.<br/><br/>The general problem with D20 that makes it rough on Nar play is that it's really tough to balance encounters, and without a balance, it can either make an encounter super deadly or simply a waste of time to run through.  This happens because you can't necessarily judge what the party size will be if each of the players is actually making individual decisions, and NPCs might decide to switch sides, as well as the fact that the given opposition might be greater or lesser depending on the motivations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117184/#Comment_117184" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T09:09:14+00:00" title="December 31, 2007  9:09AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite><br/>The general problem with D20 that makes it rough on Nar play is that it's really tough to balance encounters, and without a balance, it can either make an encounter super deadly or simply a waste of time to run through. </blockquote>\nThis reminds me of another possible issue - in some games of d20, it's optimize-character-kill-power or your character dies and you sit out the rest of the game. So you better focus alot of effort on the game, or else.<br/><br/>So maybe one approach is to dial down the deadliness of the game, conditional on the players willing to do certain things that have story-consequences. For example, give players demon-swords that can defeat any enemy... at the price of releasing demons into a far away land. Then the players have to choose whether to do fights the hard way, or the easy way with the demon swords.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117186/#Comment_117186" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T09:32:16+00:00" title="December 31, 2007  9:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've recently embarked on a similar quest (adding more Story-now functionality to D&amp;D.

In tradition play, a Gamist GM would be the "Killer GM".

I introduced a mechanism to let players influence story (you can see a current version here, <a href="http://www.scratchfactory.com/Resources/SwashCards.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scratchfactory.com/Resources/SwashCards.pdf</a> - I was using only the more "plot" not "tactical" ones, in fact I suspect my enworld post is the one that is referred to as part of basis given duplicated flavour text/titles).  They ended up used only in gamist sense not really to "change story from GM's".  When I allowed them to be traded in for what would now be called "an action point" or "conviction point" to use "making dice better", the use of them went completely to that purpose and never to influencing the larger content of fiction.<br/><br/>The other mechanic I have tried is to solicit ongoing player input into events (in advance, as Chris C. notes above, in d20 prep time for setting up encounters is important).  This has failed as players don't "seize reins".<br/><br/>I use "story XP" option from DMG, 50% of XP is carved off to "story objectives" (which I then split among various predetermined ones).  For over four years campaign bible has stated, and I've reminded players, that they are free to define the story objectives themselves replacing my predefined generic ones.  None of five players has ever done so.<br/><br/>These are creative players, three of whom have GM'd themselves at times, one of whom writes, and we've played together for a long time, there is a large safety zone of trust among us.<br/><br/>Talking about it with the five players I deal with - they mostly want to invest creative energy up front in authoring initial PC's and aspects of campaign when starting it, and then show up every week and "be told what they're doing" as long as it flows from/responds to what they first set up.  They are prepared to create backstory that fits together - they completely understand character creation in isolation is broken - but what they want is a cool adventure with neat monsters, finding glowy stuff, things if feels like "their character would be doing", a chance to "change things or make an important choice" by winning the fight, and to have "neat fights", with the GM "revealing a big story surprise" now and again after a few hints they may or may not have caught on to.  This is what they've been doing for an average of 22 years or so and want to keep doing.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117211/#Comment_117211" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T11:57:43+00:00" title="December 31, 2007 11:57AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>How many of these endeavours to tinker with d20 involve the players as full participants in their development?

It's one thing to go on some forums and claim "your not having fun."  That's dumb.  It's another thing entirely when you know what the people close to you will most enjoy but they are being too afraid or too stubborn to recognize it.  Thus if you can stretch that trust a little bit and get them to try a little newness (not the whole bag) then they may find that they are actually having more fun at the table.  It's not too much of a stretch to guess that if your unhappy gaming with the folks you play with regularly, chances are they are reaching a similar level of disatisfaction but are assuming it's other factors as the problem, not the game.<br/><br/>2.  My changes were to make D&amp;D a better game, not to story-ify it.  Let me explain.  My changes are to have things moving continuously and allow the group to build the adventures as we go.  Why is that "better?"  Collaborative Adventure Building: It ensures that the players are doing what they want, the responsibility is evenly distributed and everyone gets to enjoy "reveals."  Steady pacing: Instead of the GM directing most of the action the group all participates evenly and thus has more to do during more of the time.  Lets say a scene takes 5 minutes to resolve.  In most games that's 3 minutes of one person telling the group what's going on, a minte of the players looking at one another and maybe a minute of one or two people taking the reins.  In a scene based, evenly distributed authorship everyone gets more regular game time and the space between points they play is far shorter.  Sure, I did a few things that I think are going to add more story-punch to the narrative, but I designed my changes to allow the players to better game the system and have more input on all three levels (rules, story and development).  Most folks would agree (As Adam mentioned) that D&amp;D is a gamist playground but I even think it falls short in this respect due to the above failings.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117731/#Comment_117731" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T12:22:37+00:00" title="January  3, 2008 12:22PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my case, my players were on board at the beginning. We did group character creation, they were really excited about the Character Bonds system, and we all agreed that it would be cool to explore the issues of responsibility in a kingdom setting. Yet, somehow, it became a killfest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
