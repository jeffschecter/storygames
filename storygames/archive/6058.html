As far as role-playing games go, we're pretty big into indie games. I'm very interested in the Story Games scene and I'm the one that's organizing the RPG track at RinCon '08. We're going to have a strong indie RPG and story game focus in our RPG events: \n<ul>\n<li>Just about half of the scheduled games at the anniversary Ides event were role-playing game events. Five of the six were non-mainstream games. At regular monthly events, indie games and story games are played more often than mainstream games.<br/> </li><li>Some of the regulars at our game days include SG's own JDCorley, Kynn, and Peter Aronson, so there should be some awesome people to game with. <br/> </li><li>There is a good group of independent game designers here in Tucson; one of our announced guests is from a prototyping and development group. There's going to be a big focus on independent game development and indie games.<br/></li></ul>\nWe're also tying the convention into the cultural events around Tucson. On Halloween night, the downtown area becomes a huge costumed street party (<a href="http://wc.arizona.edu/papers/97/48/04_1.html" rel="nofollow">Nightmare on Congress Street</a>). The last day of the convention is also the day of the <a href="http://www.allsoulsprocession.org" rel="nofollow">All Souls Procession</a>, a massive street parade that is similar to Mexico's Dia de los Muertos holiday. Over ten thousand participants gather on the streets of downtown Tucson for this amazing event. We have also been working closely with the Tucson Visitor's Bureau and will be featuring some of the many local attractions in and around Tucson for our attendees from outside of town, such as the popular haunted ghost town event <a href="http://www.nightfallaz.com" rel="nofollow">Nightfall</a> at Old Tucson Studios.<br/><br/>With our debut, we're trying to pull in people from all over the state of Arizona, from as far east as El Paso and Albuquerque, and from as far west as the San Diego area.<br/><br/>The people that are organizing this event aren't just some guys that like to play games. We're the people behind <a href="http://pulpgamer.com/" rel="nofollow">the Pulp Gamer suite of podcasts</a> and <a href="http://thegamesthething.com/" rel="nofollow">The Game's The Thing podcast</a> (a/k/a the Savage Worlds podcast). We're tied into <a href="http://pubservinc.com/" rel="nofollow">major game distributors</a>, retailers <a href="http://beta.bordersstores.com/online/store/BGIView_aboutus" rel="nofollow">worldwide</a> and <a href="http://www.gamedaze.com/" rel="nofollow">local</a>, and <a href="http://dnd.meetup.com/787" rel="nofollow">local gaming groups</a>. We're game developers both <a href="http://www.shiftingskies.com" rel="nofollow">professional</a> and <a href="http://sevendemonpress.com/" rel="nofollow">amateur</a>. We're organizers that have run game conventions, <a href="http://IdesOfGaming.com" rel="nofollow">game days</a>, and <a href="http://boardgames.meetup.com/535/" rel="nofollow">gaming events</a>. We've been planning RinCon '08 for a year and we know it's going to be great.<br/><br/>You should come. It's going to be totally awesome.<br/><br/>You can find more information about RinCon at <a href="http://RinConGames.com" rel="nofollow">RinConGames.com</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135413/#Comment_135413" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T12:53:23+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 12:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2008 12:54PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back in the late 80s to mid 90s there was a gaming convention called AGOG that met in Tucson, "A Gathering Of Gamers". One year I ran the LARP there, a Vampire LARP that I wrote myself. It was a thing of beauty. The players just ran away with it.  Glad to see a gaming-specific con back in Tucson. Let's advertise the shit out of this for the next few months.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
