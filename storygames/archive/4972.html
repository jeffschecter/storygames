We started things off with the intent of playing a bunch of games, changing our game every two or three weeks, so that we could play all of the new and cool stuff that we'd bought.  I really liked this because most of my gaming experiences have been of the fairly long, convoluted campaign variety and I've been wanting to mix that up.  Also, I'm normally the guy that takes the GM role for the group as I like being the GM, so having a new game every couple of weeks keeps things fun and fresh for me.  <br/><br/>Recently I've developed an itch for a certain kind of gaming experience.  Our gaming table for Tuesday night tends to shift around a lot, with some players being able to show one week and then not being able to come the next.  Because of this, and also because I really like the idea of it, I've been hunting around for a Done In One RPG.  <br/><br/>For those not familiar with the term, Done In One is a phrase bandied about in the comic book community and is the name for stories that are done in one issue.  Setup, character introduction, plot, finale, all banged out in twenty two pages.  Continuity and development does happen over runs of the book, but someone can pick up just one issue and get a complete story out of it.  <br/><br/>My idea of a Done In One RPG is something that would allow the play group to sit down and make up their characters, run through a complete adventure/story/thing, and reach a satisfying end in about three hours.  For my group's needs the game would also be adventurous in nature and not have the kind of crunch that games like d20 and classic DnD have.  I wouldn't mind there being some carry over of stories and ideas from session to session of the game, but to support the original intent of "Done In One" it would also have to be the kind of game that wouldn't fall apart if a character or two missed sessions.  <br/><br/>I've tried running games like SotC and PTA, but they aren't fitting quite right.  SotC has a long character creation system which I love far too much to feel comfortable gutting.  PTA is the kind of game that I feel really requires there to be all of the players present at each session.  <br/><br/>So, my question is simply, do any of you guys have any suggestions for games that currently exist that support this mode of play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111736/#Comment_111736" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T16:38:57+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  4:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2007 4:39PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually have run "complete" games of SotC, Don't Rest Your Head, and Truth &amp; Justice in around two hours, including explaining the rules and doing character (and in some cases, world) creation.  The key with those system is that rules mastery isn't needed for the players and the mechanics are flexible enough for me as a GM to handle it all.<br/><br/>There are also some really neat games coming out that are meant for play in just one session.  Paul Tevis' A Penny For My Thoughts (which is an ashcan and in development) is a game that takes around three hours for four people and is a game where you create characters as you play (as you play amnesiacs regaining your memory through a story-telling play process).<br/><br/>Off-hand, I can't think of anything else.

But it's something to keep an eye out for.<br/><br/>For published games I would suggest Universalis, a setting+story creation game. Hero's Banner is great, I'll second that one as well. Shadow of Yesterday might work, I only say might because I'm not sure how long character creation is. It seems like it would be really short, though, from reading it.<br/><br/>HeroQuest works, although with some caveats. First, do on the fly character creation. Second, drop the Glorantha setting and you can incorporate on the fly setting creation as well or use another setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111759/#Comment_111759" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T18:25:39+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  6:25PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you strip it down to 3 or 4 events, the Shab Al Hiri Roach is a lot of fun in a single session.<br/><br/>I third Hero's Banner.

If you're willing to move beyond adventure, start characters with some Love and do <i>My Life with Master</i> in a single session, or play <i>carry</i> and get your Vietnam on. <br/><br/>Depending upon the size of your group, my game <i>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i> can be played in a single evening (more than 4 players would stretch a single session out beyond three hours, though). It's a GMless adventure storytelling game that facilitates action without a lot of crunch.

One observation from Polaris play I've had is "Pacing goes as fast as the most impatient player (Heart of Mistaken) wants it to." If either the Heart or Mistaken wants really fast mini-stories (with a "finale") then they can push the pace up as fast as they want it to.<br/><br/>One quirk however is some Polaris games have almost separate stories for each protagonist. So if you have an unstable group, the set of protagonists will change. This might be considered a good thing, in that hopefully people will have incentives to wrap up short arcs within a session.<br/><br/>OTOH if by finale you mean "death or final resolution of a character" you might need to adjust the rate of xp gain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111960/#Comment_111960" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T10:02:58+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:02AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://sol.kallistipress.com" rel="nofollow">Sons of Liberty</a> can play in one three-hour sitting, or in a string of single sessions with completely different playgroups.<br/><br/>Also, Paul Revere and clockwork power armor.

You do know that it's the holidays and I've got people I want to buy gifts for!  I can't be spending all of this money at IPR, but it all sounds so good...  Luckily I own some of these games already.  <br/><br/>I polled the group that was present last night and it seems that we're going to try out Don't Rest Your Head.  I might also sneak in some Lacuna while we're at it, and I'm picking up a copy of 44 from Matt because the one line descriptor that he gave made my players go "Ooooh, yeeeeah!"  Sons of Liberty has also been on the must play list for a while now, so I know that'll get some table time once the official book comes out.  I also already own both Universalis and Contenders, so I'm sure they'll see some play as well.  <br/><br/>The rest of the games all sound fantastic as well, so they'll probably find their way into the Tuesday Night Gaming Queue (and, yeah, we've got a queue).  <br/><br/>Any other suggestions?  Keep 'em coming.  I need all of the games that you guys can send my way!<br/><br/>Also (and hey, Don, sorry I never sent you an invite to TNG.  My bad, man), if any of you guys live in the greater Philadelphia area and are interested in getting in on some short form gaming, drop me a Whisper. (You too, Don.)  <br/><br/>I should also mention that all of this talk, combined with some other ideas I've had floating in my head, might lead to a Philadelphia area micro-con.  If anyone is interested in talking about that or getting involved drop me a Whisper on that as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112267/#Comment_112267" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T05:35:54+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  5:35AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear Criminal Element's pretty good, too, if the guy ever gets round to releasing it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112278/#Comment_112278" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T07:15:10+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  7:15AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>I hear Criminal Element's pretty good, too, if the guy ever gets round to releasing it.<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nYou are an evil, evil man.
