The rules of the contest specify that the entire game, rules included must fit on 18 poker-sized cards. So I'm working on a narrative-driven RPG for the contest. My design draws heavily on the structure of scenes in Daniel Solis's "Do: Pilgrims of the flying temple," with other players setting up a problem for your character based on one of his/her attributes, and you narrating your way out of that problem based on another attribute. Character generation is handled randomly with a deal of cards, like in Jason Morningstar's "Carolina Death Crawl," and involves establishing attributes, and goals, some of which create relationships with other characters. The game as it is now includes 16 cards for character generation, 1 card containing 2 scenarios, and a 1 card with the rules for the whole system. It's a SMALL amount of space to fit everything in, and I'm not sure a system this thin will hold up. I would love to have your feedback on this thing.<br/><br/>It's a pretty zany game. I wanted to keep it weird and relatively light. <br/><br/>Situations that might come up:<br/><i>In the wizard's lab, your short term memory loss and jealousy of another character get you neck deep in a cauldron of bubbling ooze, and you have to save yourself with...sarcasm?</i><br/><br/><i>At the mall, your belief that you were hired to assassinate a wizard and your multiple phobias lead you into an intense confrontation with a security guard, and you'll have to escape using your ability to speak with animals.</i><br/><br/>That's the general feel of the game. Here are the rules:<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RULES</span></b><br/><br/><i>SETUP</i><br/><br/>Deal 2 attribute cards and 2 goal cards to each player. Players pick 1 red and 1 blue attribute, 1 green and 1 yellow goal. <br/><br/><i>GAMEPLAY</i><br/><br/>1. Players pick a scenario. They pick a start player to read the scenario aloud.<br/><br/>2. Players takes turns introducing their characters to the group, stating the characters\u2019 names, attributes, goals, and any other details players would like to add. <br/><br/>3. After characters are introduced, play begins. On a player\u2019s turn:<br/><br/>   a. The other players tell a story about how the active character\u2019s red attribute leads him/her into a dangerous or challenging situation. <br/><br/>   b. The active player describes how the character attempts to use his/her blue attribute to overcome that challenge or escape the danger.<br/><br/>   c. The other players vote on whether the attempt succeeds or fails. Majority vote players narrate the result (which can never be character death). If there is a minority vote player, he/she narrates a silver lining or a complication. A silver lining should offer something small but positive to a character in a bad situation. A complication should create a small problem for a character. In case of a tie, a round of Paper, Rock, Scissors decides who is the majority vote.<br/><br/>   d. All players can use a character\u2019s goals to help narrate scenes.<br/> <br/> 4. For each goal achieved in 4 rounds, players collectively score 1 point. 2 points per player is a complete victory. 1 point per player or more is a partial victory.<br/><br/>   5. After 4 rounds, each player narrates the fate of his/her character. <br/><br/><br/><i>SCENARIOS</i><br/><br/>1. Lab of the Mad Wizard<br/>\tYou are all captives of a mad wizard, who plans to experiment on you. From your cages, you have seen previous experiments: people turned into reptilian creatures, into intangible mists, into piles of slime. You\u2019ve seen people wrapped in eternal fire that burns yet never kills. Yesterday a young boy came back from the potion room, his skin replaced by a thousand blinking eyes.<br/>\tMoments ago, the wizard accidentally cast a disorientation spell into the mirror and got himself so good that he is no longer able to concentrate on the locking spell that keeps you captive. Your cell doors swing open. This may be your only chance. But be careful! An insane, powerful, and now terribly confused wizard stalks the halls of this labyrinthine laboratory, and he will do all he can to prevent your escape. <br/>\tGood luck.<br/><br/>2. Shopping with Humans<br/>\tYour first three months as test subjects for  Pharmacorp went so well that you\u2019ve all signed contracts for the next year. Have the meds affected your thinking? It\u2019s hard to say. All you know for sure is that you\u2019ve changed. This morning, the White Coats announced a field trip to a shopping mall. It was time, they said, to see how you respond to the public. At the mall, you are each handed  $5. \u201cGo buy some socks and come back,\u201d they say. Sounds easy enough, but the ground is so soft here, and is the mall breathing? What\u2019s that whispering sound, and why are you all so nervous? Go on now. The mall closes at 8. They will expect you back before then. <br/>\tRemember, underneath the banal surface of normal life lies a vast conspiracy of evil intent, and everyone in the mall will be watching you closely.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMAGES</span></b><br/><br/>Here's what the front of the cards looks like:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2243123.png"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2243119.png"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You'll be dealt two of each type of card, and will have to choose one blue, one red, one green, and one yellow quality. So, on a given deal you might select a character like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2243125.png"/><br/><br/>You're an astral projector with a crushing need for others' approval. You're hungry for a bite of human and have a horrible secret that you absolutely must tell to the character on your right.<br/><br/>Or like this:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2243124.png"/><br/><br/>You're a take-charge kinda guy, often sidetracked by an overwhelming need to clean and organize. If you're going to be lost in a wizards lab (or the local shopping mall), you might as well make some money while you're at it, and you wouldn't mind getting a laugh out of pranking the character on your right.<br/><br/>Now your job is to work together to achieve your yellow and green goals in the space of four rounds. Your red traits will get you into trouble, and you'll have to find a way out of that trouble using your blue traits.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTIONS</span></b><br/><br/>I'm looking for general impressions and any feedback you might want to give. I'm curious to know what is missing from the system in your opinion, or what is present in it that would be best left out.<br/><br/>A couple more specific questions:<br/><br/>1. The point system? I'm referring to item 4 in the rules. Is this going to help players utilize the goals? Or is it going to make the narrative play feel "forced'? Better to drop it? <br/><br/>2. If you could add one sentence, or one small phrase to the rules, what would it be?<br/><br/>3. If you could remove one sentence or two, or one small phrase from the rules, what would it be?<br/><br/>4. Does this seem playable to you? Does it fill a niche somewhere in game playing land? Or is it just an odd duck: too light for serious gamers, to abstract or gamey for folks new to the hobby?<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PnP LINKS</span></b><br/><br/>If you want to give the game a try, I posted color and B&amp;W cards to my dropbox:<br/><br/><i>Black and White Cards:</i><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5hxcr1jnk33pgoo/18RPGFront1.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Page one front</a> <br/><a>Page one back</a> <br/><a>Page two front</a><br/><a>Page two back</a> <br/><br/><i>Color cards:</i><br/><a>Page one front</a> <br/><a>Page one back</a> <br/><a>Page two front</a> <br/><a>Page two back</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/williamj35" title="williamj35"><img alt="williamj35" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/williamj35">williamj35</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438759/#Comment_438759" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-27T18:44:11+00:00" title="September 27, 2014  6:44PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

I don't have any advice on the cards though, I feel I'd need to playtest it to see how it runs before making any recommendations.  I do think points are good for a certain type of player.  Some people play to win, others play for story.  So if your system can accommodate both of those players at the same time without becoming seriously unbalanced, I think you've got something worth retaining.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/williamj35" title="williamj35"><img alt="williamj35" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/williamj35">williamj35</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438763/#Comment_438763" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-27T19:20:51+00:00" title="September 27, 2014  7:20PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks AsIf!<br/><br/>I was able to play test today, and I posted a play test session report here:<br/><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/article/17023487#17023487" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://boardgamegeek.com/article/17023487#17023487</a><br/><br/>The group I was with was definitely playing for story.
