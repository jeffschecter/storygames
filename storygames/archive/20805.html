I have heard different takes on this: some say this helps designers get sales because of exposure; some say that it is stealing and that everyone should buy a copy (especially because we should be supporting the indie community). Since I'm starting a large group with multiple subgroups, I'm wondering what my policy should be on this. Can you guys weigh in; especially, those of you who sell your games for money? Does Anyone know how Story Games Seattle and other groups handle this?

That way they can be exposed to the game and if they like it they will purchase it, and if they're lame cheapskates we won't be facilitating them ripping it off. Thanks for the great answer. I also think that I should say that we might give a play-aid sheet (enough to get by during play only) but we recommend that you buy the game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Also, if they come a lot and play the same game regularly, I think we should require it, not just hint at it.

Nowadays there's an exception to that for software, but that wouldn't apply to paper copies, as far as I know. (It might apply to pdf books, but I'm not aware of any authoritative legal opinions one way or another.)<br/><br/>(My understanding is that American rpg publishers traditionally act under the assumption that they have the authority to set strict and invasive copyright limitations on personal use; for example, older games generally used to have strict boilerplate statements about which parts of the book are OK to photocopy for your gaming. I am pretty skeptical about whether these supposed limitations and permissions were ever as authoritative as they're presented, as it seems to me that the American principle of Fair Use would handily cover most copying of a rpg book that a person might wish to do for the sake of playing the game. Not my problem, nor my area of expertise, though.)<br/><br/>Considering the law, this is a non-issue here in Finland, although people may of course have different opinions regardless. Speaking as a designer and publisher, limited to my own games, I endorse any and all sorts of non-commercial copywrongs that do not infringe on moral droits d\u2019auteur - I don't monitor the (non-profit) piracy, won't prosecute it, nor shame anybody for it, in accordance with my convictions on the copyright issue in general.<br/><br/>Not everybody feels the way I do, though, and we are living a time of great change in the culture industry, so you'll be certain to meet differing opinions; if you do decide to make copies for your play group, even of a game that cannot be realistically played without doing so, odds are that somebody will find this action offensive. I suppose that you could seek for some sort of a community standard to support your decision (such as by posting here about it), but I don't know if that does anything except help you feel better about it if what you decide to do offends some random person in the Internet. Even if we all agreed here in this thread that this or that is the community standard, surely such a decision would be rather non-authoritative in the eyes of anybody else.<br/><br/>If you're mostly afraid of controversy, I suggest simply contacting the publisher of whatever game you want to copy out to your players, and ask them about it. They'll surely have an opinion, a preconception of what the "usage licence" for their game is supposed to be in their own eyes. If they're OK with it, you're in the clear, and if they're not, then perhaps you will want to desist from doing it. If a third party gets offended by what you're doing, an explicit permission from the publisher would probably calm them down pretty nicely.<br/><br/>Note that it is common for small press games to be constructed in a way that does not require every player to have a rulebook. In fact, most "story games" tend towards a mentoring model where one player teaches the game to the rest after reading a rulebook, and the book itself is hardly used for the play itself. It's mostly games with character builds that might favour each player having their own book, so as to facilitate character planning outside sessions and look-ups during. Despite having a pretty full schedule of gaming, I hardly ever encounter a situation where the group has multiple copies of the rulebook handy at the table.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456760/#Comment_456760" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-30T21:54:39+00:00" title="September 30, 2016  9:54PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2016 10:04PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a><br/>Not really worried about the legal, more wondering about what is the best (read right) thing to do.

I should make note of that on our own web page, too, I'd just plain forgotten about that. I'm not seeing IPR getting a resupply, as SS hasn't sold that well in the US (and we're almost out here, too), so I guess I'll recommend one of the html versions that are out there. (Or the pdf, which I'm still selling for a few euros.) The paper booklet is very nice for its price, but hardly necessary for enjoying the game.<br/><br/>Technically I could mail the booklet from here, but the postage is a bit steep, particularly for such a cheap-o product. I guess that getting you a paper copy of <i>While the World Ends</i> (I've got a few copies left sitting in the inventory of my little Finnish indie retail webstore) would be an added bonus, but that still probably wouldn't be worth it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456763/#Comment_456763" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-30T22:15:37+00:00" title="September 30, 2016 10:15PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2016 10:38PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eeru_Tuovinen">@Eeru_Tuovinen</a><br/>Cool thanks, I'll get a copy of the HTML or the PDF (especially if the PDF is better organized and easier to read).

But since I'm starting an organization with multiple groups a kind of "Indie RPGs &amp; Story Games SLC", akin to Story Games Seattle but with the edition of RPGs; I was thinking my policy should be to only provide the absolute bare materials, like a summary sheet, and to suggest that people buy the book if they can. Also, if it is a game they play regularly, I might require them to buy the book. I'm trying to both support the indie community and not alienate members. What do you think?

We reference them at the table.  I don't have a physical copy of this game (it doesn't yet exist).  If I did, having a single physical copy at the table would replace the need to print out a copy.<br/><br/>For a gaming "club" I would be a little more hesitant to print out a game -not because of any particular qualms about having a printed copy that, once again, would live "with me" or at least, "with the club" but because it feels a little bit shoddy and casual.  If I showed up to a game club and everyone was playing off dogeared printouts, I would be a little concerned.<br/><br/>If anyone really needs to have a copy for a short period of time, I can lend one, or we can collaborate over the PDF.  If they need one for a longer period, they should buy their own.<br/><br/>So I guess what it comes down to is: printing out for casual use is fine, but I wouldn't print things out to just hand out to people to take home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456887/#Comment_456887" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-05T15:29:13+00:00" title="October  5, 2016  3:29PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(My understanding is that American rpg publishers traditionally act under the assumption that they have the authority to set strict and invasive copyright limitations on personal use; for example, older games generally used to have strict boilerplate statements about which parts of the book are OK to photocopy for your gaming. </blockquote>\nMy vague understanding is that, back in the day, Kinkos (a commercial copy center) refused to make copies of things out of books to avoid copyright lawsuits.

Satire is about the only safe harbor in terms of Fair Use. Mind you, Fair Use is a <i>defense</i> in court against an infringement suit, so by the time you have to rely on it, you're already paying a lawyer.<br/><br/>Agreed that you can't copy an entire manuscript under Fair Use. Generally fails under the "amount and substantiality" clause you mentioned, but also because Fair Use usually requires transformation of the work copied.<br/><br/>Actually applying the rules of Fair Use is nearly impossible to do right and with a guarantee of safe harbor from lawsuit, except in a few really clear-cut cases. Also, people can sue you anyway, even if you're within the law, and you probably can't afford to defend  yourself.<br/><br/>The Supreme Court barely understands Copyright Law in all of its insane glory.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456905/#Comment_456905" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-05T23:01:43+00:00" title="October  5, 2016 11:01PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, now that I think about it, I suspect if you recorded any of my sessions and showed them to the designer of the game I was running, they might classify what I was doing as satire just to get away from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457426/#Comment_457426" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-24T02:03:25+00:00" title="October 24, 2016  2:03AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There are a lot of gaming stores in SLC that offer free hosting and people don't have to pay to find a gaming group. .... soft suggestion, like give them a sheet that has the website to the game and say something like: "If you like this game you can get a copy at X<br/></blockquote>\nIf you're playing at a game store it's better to buy the game at the game store if you can than order it online.
