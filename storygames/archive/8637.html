I've got some conclusions that might be instructive to all of us when we try to dig into them for inspiration: the fiction <em>promises</em> certain things, but then it softpedals them. I come back because I'm hoping to see those themes addressed by noticing new stuff in the source fiction. (Also, I come back because Lucas's design crews were stunningly good on IV-VI and the movies are straight up <em>beautiful</em>.)</p>\n<p>So screw that. I'm doing my own treatment.</p>\n<p>There are a number of classical themes that just weren't OK to put into a movie in the 1970s, least of all a G-rated one. I think those themes are kind of central, though, particularly in a story that takes a moral standpoint. But we're grownups here, and we make stories for our own benefit without the concerns of budget or ratings. Here's how I would do it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Incest. Luke and Leia have a child.</li>\n<li>Jealousy. Han and Luke's relationship to Leia \u2014 and their need and resentment toward each other \u2014\xa0is their strength and their weakness.</li>\n<li>Feminism. It's not a classical theme, but it's an important one. Leia's struggle is about guiding the Alliance to victory through politics and action. The Force shows itself in her by her ability to read and change minds. She can see motives from across the galaxy. She wants to be a just ruler in a system that hasn't had one in generations.</li>\n<li>The \u0152dipal struggle. Luke kills Vader. Han and Leia, the leaders of the Rebellion, raise Luke's child as their own. When Luke's jealousy gets the better of him, he's killed by his son. He can be redeemed by his son, too, but the important thing is that Luke wind up either supporting his own son's growth or being destroyed for refusing to. Personally, I like the former. I like the idea that conflicts can be resolved, even in the thick, by doing what's right on all parties' parts. It would be good to see the Republic move forward <em>reducing</em> the blood on its hands.</li>\n<li>Han's voyage from mercenary to hero. He leaps in to save Luke. Luke leaps in to save him. Han <em>knows</em> the child isn't his, but he's doing what he can to make things right for the people he loves \u2014 Leia, his "son", the Republic, and, reluctantly, Luke. It doesn't mean he always acts well. I see him as kind of tragic; he's of secondary importance to Luke, who can accomplish greatness as a hero. He's of secondary importance to Leia, who winds of Queen of the Republic. He's of secondary importance to his "own son", who's destined to be the most powerful and wise Jedi in history. Han's a support character, and he knows it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some other fun stuff:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Droids are slaves. Good people leave off the restraining bolts, just like house slaves didn't wear chains. Given agency, how do they prove their humanity? What can be said about that?</li>\n<li>Non-humans. The Empire is clearly and wholly racist. There are only humans. The Rebel Alliance is egalitarian, in that cowardly squidmen can be admirals. Without the constraints of moviedom (needing expressive faces, keeping within a budget) what does the Alliance look like?</li>\n<li>Economy. What does the Empire look like, with its healthy black market? How does the Republic deal with an economy that, for a generation, has been almost wholly illegal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind: the idea here isn't to "dirty up" Star Wars. It's not to make good characters into bad people, or amp up the violence or anything that shallow. It's to put the characters in a position to really address the themes that are only hinted at in the source.</p>\n<p>(I'll do Star Trek in another thread when I've thought about it more.

Maybe this caused the death of a senator whose son is actually a young Padawan named Anakin. And all the "point of view" mumbo-jumbo of his master Obi Wan never really closed that wound. A Jedi named Yoda, fed up with the Jedi politics quits the council and leaves for a far away swamp planet.<br/><br/>Sometime in the future Obi Wan may let his last pupil kill him to atone for his sins. (Maybe he's the one who killed Anakin's mother, who knows ?)<br/><br/>The Old Republic is now greatly outnumbered by several alien species who want to stop Man's dominance. The Senate allows the cloning of its citizens to built itself an army. Every citizen accepting to be cloned is given a pension, as long as his clone lives.<br/><br/>Being used as a slave army, some clones awaken and start talking about freedom. After pacifying half the galaxy, several clone legions revolt, leading to a civil war (whose name I don't need to tell you).<br/><br/>Clones are granted full citizenship and a place at the senate, the most decorated officer of the clone army, general Palpatine becomes a senator. He resents the Jedis who where once used to stop the clones revolt. <br/><br/>He starts searching for ways to protect himself from the Jedi, sending his must trusted men across the Galaxy.<br/><br/>After the Republic pacification campaign many disgruntled alien government regroup and take advantage of the clone wars aftermath to wipe out the human race once and for all. <br/><br/>The old Hero, senator Palpatine says he can save the republic once more. The Jedis are divided : some want to help Palpatine, others try to reach a peaceful solution. Anakin, remembering the role of the Jedis in his mother's death joins Palpatine.<br/><br/>The senate issues Order 66 : every Jedi who will not fight for the Republic is branded a traitor. The Jedi order collapses, Jedis kill each other. Only one survives...<br/><br/>Anakin's wife fought for peace, she leaves her husband and flee with Obi Wan Kenobi. She gives birth to her twins. Later on she will fall in love with former senator Organa.<br/><br/>Oh my god, this whole thing got more holes than my daddy's rubber. But hey, call me crazy, but I'd definitely run a game with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191244/#Comment_191244" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T16:53:51+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  4:53PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, but I think the real juice is in the overlooked word in the title of the series.

Hey, Wade, I got a mother, you got a mother, the sarge has got a mother. I'm willing to bet that even the Captain's got a mother. Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have got mothers.

God was here before the Marine Corps - so you can give your heart to Jesus, but your ass belongs to the Corps. A deer's gotta be taken with one shot. But be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again.

Sure, the Jedi talk about a Light Side and a Dark Side, but in reality the Force is Life Energy and life is both beautiful and brutal and filled with passion and emotion.<br/><br/>The Jedi say they are all about becoming "One with the Force" but really they are afraid of it, so the repress their emotions, they control their feelings and they deny their humanity. It's all about control.<br/><br/>The Sith embrace the Force; they give in to emotion; love, rage, passion, you name it.  Of course in the end they are consumed by their emotions, but hey, it's a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>There are good and bad eggs in both camps. <br/><br/>The Emperor represents the worst the Sith; he's consumed by hate and ambition, and the Force in him has become curropt and foul. <br/><br/>Vader serves the Emperor but he's still Jedi through and through. He represses his grief and his despair and has not only lost his humanity, but his connection to the force as well. His once mighty Force powers have diminished to a feeble trickle.<br/><br/>Luke (or maybe his daughter?) has been taught to follow the Jedi path, but maybe over time he (she) begins to see that the force isn't something to be repressed and controlled, but embraced, as long as one does not lose oneself in the process.

The only Wars that happen in Star Wars is this slow background conflict of skimishes which results in a flurry of action in eps 1 and 3, but otherwise no real Wars: Nothing like the Colonials vs the Natives of Africa, India etc, nor... well... any real feel of "WAR" other than "SKIRMISH".<br/><br/>But "<b>ISOLATED STAR SKIRMISHES</b>" sounds lame, so, I guess that's why they went with "<b>STAR WARS</b>".<br/><br/>For me, I agree with JD, but would add something like:<br/><br/>1) Fewer "X Wings", more focus on Capital Ships. Make Capital Ships the default, kinda like that Japanese Manga series about the space empire battles that are fought between tens of thousands of capital ships at a time, where most of the capital ships are basically BIG FAT GUN with ENGINES.<br/><br/>2) Or somehow change the physics so that capital ship lasers are not as effective as basically ramming your capital ships into theirs, and sending 10,000 soldiers into hand to hand combat (small lasers, swords, etc) with their 10,000 soldiers. Then, I'd keep the little X-Wings and stuff, but they would basically do little more than fly over the capital ships and strafe into the enemy combatants, and dogfight with each other over the enemy combatants.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>PS: Incest is in my "lines/veils", under "veils", so I'd not go there (no interest), but I'd basically up the ante on everything BIG and SHINY in the setting.
