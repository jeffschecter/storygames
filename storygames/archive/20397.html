By real magic people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers. No, I answer, conjuring tricks, not real magic. Real magic, in other words, refers to the magic that is not real, while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."</blockquote>\nPeople find magical explanations more "real" than physical explanations.  I myself am fascinated with spirits living in rivers, rocks, storms, and computers.  It's not that I believe they do exist; rather, I believe they *should* exist.  The world is less without them.<br/><br/>But <i>why</i> do I, and others, feel this way?  I suspect we apply a generalized Czege Principle.  A magical explanation feels Other in a way that a physical explanation does not.  Any physical system we can identify with, make a tool, embody, etc.  The more we understand it, the more it becomes just a part of ourselves.  Magic, on the other hand, is always something we can't fully command or subsume.  It is separate by definition, and so any interaction with magic is a dance with a partner.  A magical explanation is a GM; a physical explanation is a system.  <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Now, I'm not up on how theory has progressed since the Czege Principle was popular.  I know there have been good arguments made for solo play, but I've never an updated theory that accounts for the newly acquired nuance.  But my hypothesis is that whatever nuances have been applied to the Czege Principle could, though analogy, apply as well to questions of when to appeal to magic in fictional content (or reality, for that matter) vs. when to appeal to more physical explanations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449061/#Comment_449061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-16T20:50:30+00:00" title="October 16, 2015  8:50PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating ideas Burr<br/>That magical principle can be applied to understanding many of lifes mysteries of otherness. <br/>Fear comes to mind.

If it is true that we can apply the crude version of the Czege Principle in a more generalized fashion, then it is likely also true that its limitations extend as well.  Well-designed solo play can be fun, so there's a challenger to the Czege Principle.  That implies constraints, and constraints in a complex system suggest the opportunity for emergent understandings.  What's the greater principle at work, how might it apply to magical thinking vs. system thinking, and how can we apply that in turn to the division of ideas between fictional content and system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449063/#Comment_449063" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-16T22:38:32+00:00" title="October 16, 2015 10:38PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (For reference for those who aren't aware, the Czege Principle is "creating your own adversity and its resolution is boring.")<br/><br/>The Czege Principle is something I've been thinking about lately. Partially because I'm trying to design a GM-light game where players moderate for each other. The players frequently create their own problems, and I'm having a harder time than I thought getting them to not solve their own problems. I'm definitely interested in whether this discussion can give me any insight into getting beyond this conundrum.<br/><br/>As for your specific question, I can only speculate at this point. At first blush, the idea that we need to ascribe the agency to something outside ourselves is probably important. I'm not sure yet if it's the only answer.<br/><br/>What's fun about solo play? What are some good examples of it? What tools are there that might help manage the adversity/resolution problem?<br/><br/>The few times I've done solo play, the overriding adversity was that the story had to follow a narrative logic; the goal was to try and see what would happen while not invalidating my sense of simulation and making sense. I don't know if this lines up with anyone else's solo play.<br/><br/>Though experiment: There are times when we can have systems that provide enough adversity. Blackjack and Roulette are entirely driven by rules and physics, respectively. Co-op board games like Ghost Stories or Pandemic are entirely driven by the interactions between the rules and the cards. Now, these systems have a goal set for you, so its not quite the same thing as creating your own adversity. Can we have a story game system that provides similar constraints for the resolution while allowing you to set your own adversity? What tools does solo play use to deal with this? Can they be used in group play?<br/><br/>Hope these thoughts help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449066/#Comment_449066" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-17T10:22:42+00:00" title="October 17, 2015 10:22AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you trying to promote magical thinking within solo games? <br/>This type of thinking requires setting/ setting up if thats the correct term.<br/>The magician setting of paraphernalia, the storytellers voice choice of words setting.<br/>A film follows a setting of logic that suspends disbelief. <br/>As you say what you are trying to create is like craft or a dance with the other and not system.<br/>So solo games should be setting / setup heavy, Theme wording art ritual lots paraphernalia, <br/>Crafted to evoke magical thinking  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449067/#Comment_449067" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-17T13:14:31+00:00" title="October 17, 2015  1:14PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: magical thinking in solo play<br/><br/>I think I've definitely seen some of this in the way some describe "gm emulators" (particularly Mythic).

They provide some pushback, but I can't deceive myself as to what is happening. occulus and de Profundis sort of get me halfway there, but I find that I'm more engaged if I go a bit meta. <br/><br/>Ie, for oculus, I may  roleplay someone who is using oculus as a talisman that uses dice, rather than play myself as the person looking in. So, in my mind's eye I may see someone else sitting down at a desk playing with the Oracle, and then dive in once more to see what they're seeing.  <br/><br/>For de profundis, doing something along those lines would help me as well, so I might Houserule that whenever I think something in the real world would make a cool happening for the character writing letters, the character sees it in his world.

It can be used to create adventures and worlds or to play in pre-prepared ones and also improvised games.<br/><br/>It has both a resolution mechanic based on card numerical values and also an interpretative aspect based on reading card meanings and mashing them into what you need, like people link disjointed information to build a conspiracy theory or see shapes in natural formations they read as faces etc. You make the meanings fit to the need in game, stretching and bending them to build characters, narratives and so on as you play.<br/><br/>It's called 'Fortune's Wheel' and the kickstarter is here:<br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613337354/fortunes-wheel" rel="nofollow">https://kickstarter.com/projects/1613337354/fortunes-wheel</a><br/>Some other useful links:<br/>Free Sample PDF: <br/>Game blog: <a href="http://hybridartifacts.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">hybridartifacts.tumblr.com/</a><br/>Website: <a href="http://hybridartifacts.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">hybridartifacts.tumblr.com/</a><br/>Facebook: <a href="http://www.fortuneswheel.co.uk/Fortunes-Wheel-Quickstart.pdf" rel="nofollow">fortuneswheel.co.uk/Fortunes-Wheel-Quickstart.pdf</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449101/#Comment_449101" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-23T19:18:47+00:00" title="October 23, 2015  7:18PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh, I remember fondly a Story-Games that thought pimping your game(outside of Directed Promotion)was a bit shameless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449102/#Comment_449102" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-23T19:19:05+00:00" title="October 23, 2015  7:19PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those were good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449103/#Comment_449103" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T05:46:17+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  5:46AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The more we understand it, the more it becomes just a part of ourselves.  Magic, on the other hand, is always something we can't fully command or subsume.  It is separate by definition, and so any interaction with magic is a dance with a partner.</blockquote>\nWell said!  I agree.  I think this distinction separates magical-feeling RPG magic from scientific-feeling RPG magic.\n<blockquote>A magical explanation is a GM; a physical explanation is a system.</blockquote>\nIn a game where everything comprehensible was handled solely by a system, I would agree.  As is, though, in games where GMs arbitrate and communicate not only the unknown but also the known, I think that distinction is lost.<br/><br/>It might be fun to have two GMs:<br/>- One for the mundane operations of the setting, who always needs to be able to explain themselves if asked.<br/>- One for the magical events of play, who isn't even allowed to explain themselves if asked.<br/><br/>Two different types of player interaction for two different types of character experience.<br/><br/>For all the various clever magic systems out thee, I have yet to see one where the arbiter of spell effects is a hidden partner.  It might be really cool to have a GM secretly create a character who is Magic, and then arbitrate all spells by the wishes and abilities of that character.  The player characters would never meet Magic, but over the course of repeated interactions, they might learn things about it.<br/><br/>Not that this has anything to do with solo play or the limits of making your own adversity; just running with what the opening post inspired me to brainstorm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449110/#Comment_449110" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T17:01:32+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  5:01PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It might be fun to have two GMs:<br/>- One for the mundane operations of the setting, who always needs to be able to explain themselves if asked.<br/>- One for the magical events of play, who isn't even allowed to explain themselves if asked.<br/></blockquote>\nThis sounds like the Gm who looses his magic and becomes a railroading rulemeister <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I thought we were looking for the ghost in the machine or rules.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449112/#Comment_449112" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T17:39:02+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  5:39PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2015 5:39PM by AsIf.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>- One ... who isn't even allowed to explain themselves if asked.</blockquote>\nNow this is beauty, to me.
