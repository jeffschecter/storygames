I wonder why that is?<br/><br/>What's interesting for me is that I've been playing AD&amp;D with two groups, one predominantly Story Gamers (in which I GM), the other decidedly unreconstructed (in which I run a character). Even though the approaches are different, both very good fun.<br/><br/>With the Old Schools it's all about killing the most monsters and getting the treasure but the group goes way back (20+ years) and the characters are so well established (20+ levels) that there exists a common history and understanding that in many ways is the same as that which Story Gamers seek to create. There's a lot of tension in the group dynamic that results from many years of adventuring together and ripping each other off. And whilst most of the characters are the cautious norm, one is so gloriously gung-ho that he drives the game forward at a speed close to that of Story Gaming.<br/><br/>We've got the same kinds of things going on in the Story Game group but without having to play for years to establish them. And the advantage of AD&amp;D is that it is so gloriously vanilla and simple that there are no stumbling blocks in establishing characters because you really have to be dense, or wilfully disruptive, to misconstrue the background and purpose of play. So whilst XPs and levels are revelled in, for me, as a GM, it's a delight to be part of all the character play and the establishment of story.<br/><br/>That said, to a certain extent, I'm glad I'm not playing a character in the Story Game group because I find levels something of a bore but around 20th level they make little difference                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191625/#Comment_191625" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T05:26:34+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  5:26AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 5:27AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been playing Mentzer Basic D&amp;D and one thing I noticed immediately was that we formed pretty strong adversarial relationships among ourselves.  I'm an Elf, and I stand for law, and Joel's playing a cleric who worships Tiamat and is an evil jerk, so we go round and round to good effect.  Joe played a sort of dumb barbarian who became a pawn in our extended struggle.  So there was a lot of colorful interplay, despite the fact that we all had 3 hit points and were useless whelps.  Now we've survived and leveled up (well, Joe's barbarian had an unfortunate mishap and is ... resting), and now have a shared backstory as well as the ersatz drama we created out of nothing.  <br/><br/>It's really fun and interesting to observe the smallest of details, given a universe in which detail is a rarity, blossoming into full-fledged plot and character elements.  We acquired some hirelings, and as far as the rules are concerned these guys are just meat shields, but one of them is a little more dextrous and one of them, by chance, has a buttload of hit points, and pretty soon they are twin brothers out for revenge and an evil thief named Cilantro and generally memorable and likable dudes.  I'm enjoying the creative constraints a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191631/#Comment_191631" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T07:24:43+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  7:24AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's this "Old School"?<br/><br/>No seriously: Is it playing an old game? Or simply using an old play style, generally understood to be the play style encouraged by the older games? What games or play styles qualify?<br/><br/>There's some meat in that question, I think, but I'm only asking it because I recently started a 4E game, but for the sole purpose of experiencing old school dungeon crawls. Why am I not doing it in an early version of D&amp;D? Mostly because I find the rule set dreadful, to be honest, leading to boring and repetitive play where the majority of the players have few or no interesting choices to make.<br/><br/>So, if I qualify for "Old School" with that definition of play, what's my experience? I'm loving the game for what it is, and after the first and only session we've played so far, the players appear to as well. But are we really playing it "Old School"? Not particularly, no.<br/><br/>I prepped a pile of encounters, some skill challenges, a dungeon, a city above the dungeon, and a motive for the PCs to be there. The players prepped a whole pile of PCs, maybe 15+ total, since we wanted to make sure that regardless of who showed on a given session they'd have all of the four PC roles covered.<br/><br/>To help out with tying the PCs into the world, I posted some setting material - Dictionary of Mu style - on a wiki.<br/><br/>Then, one of the players suggested that everyone write another entry, or add a major detail to an existing entry, for each character they had. Most of the players went nuts with this and greatly expanded the setting, forming a more coherent world - enough that I could translate it into an area map. Suddenly, we had a bunch of factions, cities, deities and ancient artifacts, and PCs tied into them.<br/><br/>Play began, and the players - rather than triggering the neat little skill challenge I had prepped which would eventually lead them straight to the dungeon - decide to push on to the walled city and brave the night guards. They proceed to do a bunch of role-playing, helping rolls, and finally a big Diplomacy roll beating a DC of 25+. The guard - of course - lets them in, against his given orders.<br/><br/>Off to the inn, and some more role-playing. I pull out my sheet of randomly generated NPCs and decide to make a few of them important, for some reason - why? A few moments later the wizard has been made a prophet of Sehanine and is granted the quest to find the lord of the city a mate - why? I don't know - I just took what the players gave me and latched on.<br/><br/>And off we go to the castle, and now we're so far off the rails I have to stop the game and tell the players, "Fine, okay, you're going to the castle - but, I'd like to fade to black there, and then frame a scene where you've been taken to the dungeons to await the lord's arrival". I had an NPC in the castle that could give them something to do, and this would be a fine time to bring him in. Sure, says the players. So the NPC shows up, reprimands them for breaking into the city, and indicates the guard will be punished - the paladin makes a big deal out of this and swears he will show for the guard's trial a week hence (minor quest!). Now, the NPC tells them that no, the lord is unavailable, but - but, says the players, we must see him, we are on a holy quest, see, here's our divine artifact! More Diplomacy rolls, and the players are granted a brief audience with the lord, who I had no idea what to do with. I'm back in uncharted waters, and we're still not rolling any dice other than the occasional social skill.<br/><br/>Well, the lord shows in his nightgown, obviously close to a nervous breakdown, and starts spilling all of his problems (goblins in the farmlands, kobolds kidnapping local women, disease, theft, and so on). Thankfully, the rogue latches on, here - "goblins, eh? how much per head?". The lord mentions a price and the players go off to find the goblins. Back on track! Finding the goblins is a skill challenge I've set up. The players start picking skills, rolling, playing scenes - I start dropping little clues here and there to reveal a larger narrative of what's been happening in the city prior to their arrival - and eventually, the players are attacked due to a failed Stealth skill roll.<br/><br/>First encounter, after 3 of the 4 hours! The goblins have a surprise round and slaughter the wizard before she gets a chance to say hocus pocus. The paladin decides in that moment he is deeply in love with the wizard - whether due to Sehanine's influence or not - and charges into the horde of goblins to shelter her bloodied corpse. After a short, brutal, and vividly described fight scene, the remaining goblins run off. But the paladin calls out to Sehanine to restore her prophet and his soul mate to life. I can't miss an opportunity like that, so I give him a quest - one which should suitably challenge his own beliefs and establish Sehanine as a fickle divinity with a personality incomprehensible to mortals. Because, you know, I can't just give him a quest to recover some artifact or donate some gold or something, it has to be something that is transformative to his character.<br/><br/>Moral of the story? I don't know, exactly. Maybe we're story games brain damaged? Maybe system doesn't matter? No, them's fightin' words. Here's what I really think: We were playing two different games. There was one really exciting miniature combat game with some vivid description thrown in, and one game of story crafting and character development. Oddly, we all agreed to go into it for the purpose of exploring old-school hack-n-slash, but in play we were all really happy to put that on the back burner anytime there was an opportunity for character interaction and development.<br/><br/>Next, I think I should run Sword and Sorcerer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191632/#Comment_191632" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T07:37:09+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  7:37AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 7:37AM by GB_Steve.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're not playing Old School, by your own admission, then take it to another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191636/#Comment_191636" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T08:06:50+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  8:06AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, sorry if you find my additions to this thread as obstructive to its purpose. I guess I'm confused - the title of the thread seems to indicate a dichotomy between "Old School" and "Story Gamers" and specifically call for experiences. Since we set out to experience "Old School" with 4E but instead started falling back into what might be described as story gamer techniques, leading to a style of play far more oriented towards character development and story crafting - as you claim to experience with AD&amp;D also - I thought my comments would be useful or at least amusing.<br/><br/>Perhaps we need to go back to my initial question - what is "Old School"? I interpret it as dungeon crawling, hack'n'slashing, and prioritizing leveling and acquisition of wealth. We're not particularly doing this so far in this game, despite using a rule set which presumably favours this style of play and despite everyone agreeing that's what we wanted to do. Perhaps you have a different definition, based on the game system? Is AD&amp;D Old School but 4E is not (despite many claims that 4E is more true to original D&amp;D than 2nd Ed AD&amp;D)? What about Runequest? What about Palladium? What about Ars Magica?<br/><br/>I'll be happy to remove my comment if it's obstructive, but I thought it best to ask the above first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191658/#Comment_191658" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T09:58:35+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  9:58AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 9:59AM by Adam_Dray.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;caustic sarcasm&gt;Yeah, Filip.

If Old School refers primarily to a dungeon-crawling/loot/leveling style rather than to a specific rule set, I'm playing a lot of 4E lately because it's a well-designed game that is a hell of a lot of fun.  I suspect 4E might not qualify as Old School for most despite its play modes.  Still, I'd be curious if the resurgent interest in D&amp;D due to 4E was a catalyst for any others to go back and play some of the early versions.<br/><br/>That said, I most look forward to my next Sorcerer/Polaris/PTA/IaWA/etc fix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191691/#Comment_191691" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T12:33:24+00:00" title="February  9, 2009 12:33PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>What were you shouting about, Jason?</blockquote>\nWe were just enjoying being knuckleheads and cheering each other on, chewing the scenery and enjoying ourselves.

I wondered why you'd bothered posting something you said wasn't an answer to the question. Even if I thought it was. But it was a good story so I'm glad you posted it, even if you're now as confused as I am.<br/><br/>OS is largely a matter of self-definition and given than it's not worth arguing about. If you think you're a Story Gamer and you think you've been playing some Old School games, I'd like to hear about your experiences. Experiences, that's what it's about, not snide comments.<br/><br/>We did a lot of shouting across each other and grabing centre stage along with some reflection and some great character play. Cross party antagonism seems to be the order of the day for us in any game that doesn't give us enough of a story challenge. It's easy to set up and it can run for ages. And then Graham had a thief with Charisma 5 (out of 18) which he played as just very dull. He kept explaining things to the n-th degree and it was very funny. And Simon has got an Orc henchman in hat of disguise. And there was the long discussion between the Paladin and the Cleric/Mage/Fighter as to whethe a were-rat was inherently evil or could be trusted as your gamekeeper.<br/><br/>Our games of 4e were a bit like this but the incessant fighting got in the way. It was so channeled into a mini-figs war game that there was less room to maneuver and talk to NPCs. Perhaps if we'd played it more and got bored of the powers we'd have tried to story it up a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191724/#Comment_191724" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T16:40:24+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  4:40PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awhile back I got to play Moldvay Red Box with Ben Lehman running, though I had a big disconnect because I was raised on the newer Mentzer Red Box.  <br/><br/>It wasn't until just a couple months back when I got to look at the Moldvay set that I saw a major difference.  Whereas every edition of D&amp;D says, "don't use the rules if you don't want to", only Moldvay really came at it specifically, "Say what you want to do, the GM makes up some rules and then you go", which is a very necessary thing to say, when you're trying to teach folks coming at it whose experience is from boardgames (if it isn't in the rules you can't do it).  <br/><br/>This crucial bit of info seems to have been handed down mostly via oral teaching, and the rest of us who didn't get it, simply, didn't understand how you were "supposed to" play the game.<br/><br/>So basically, my experiences have been for old school - "Hey, here's a character" "dead"  "Hey, here's another character" "dead", "Hey, one person survived the adventure- mad XP level up", etc.<br/><br/>Now armed with this bit of crucial info, I expect the next time I run/play something old school I might be able to give a solid account.

Have you seen or learned anything from your old-school play that you'd want take to a hippie table?  <br/><br/>One of the things you mention in your post as a plus of OD&amp;D is the combination of simplicity and an inevitable "purpose of play" \u2014 by that, I'm thinking you mean that the rules and setting details give everybody a strong push in the same direction of making guys who kill monsters for gps, and that as long as everyone thinks that's fun, fun it will be?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can definitely endorse that conclusion.  The question is: Is that the same thing as saying that players have fun insofar as they share a Creative Agenda?  Or is there a larger or different lesson?<br/><br/>I ask, not because I don't think traditional games are often fun, but because I am still wracking my brain for more answers to the question of why some of my old school gaming sessions have succeeded, and some of them failed.  It sounds like you folks must have some ideas on the topic, given your mostly happy reports.  The Forge guys have a theory, which is great, but I'm looking for engineering answers where all they have is physics (a metaphor - their theory isn't that complete/well-founded/descriptive, obviously, just bear with me).  What I want to know is what concrete techniques are likely to help me run <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> as successfully as possible, as frequently as possible?  And the way I'm getting to that question is: What are you doing and seeing in fun games of OD&amp;D?

I'm not sure if its precisely us "not getting it", or if its just not the sort of play style that I am geared for, but I really dislike the amount of time that the party eventually spends on logistics.  Be it overland travel, or which hallways to navigate first in the dungeon, I find that maybe like 1/3rd of our play time essentially boils down to the players arguing over left-or-right.<br/><br/>Otherwise all of the free-form do whatever we want has been pretty exciting.  All of the combats we've had have been more interesting than any other version of D&amp;D I've played, and I really like how the characters seem genuinely fearful of the dungeon that they are in.  But I wish we could kind of expand the awesomeness and cut down <i>some</i> of the traversal planning, WITHOUT doing it through wandering-monster rolls.

And I do enjoy the logistics  (even down to "how many torches to take", "how many nights to spend at a tavern healing vs how much it costs") and the attrition mechanic that wandering monsters are, even though I'm well aware of how boring that can be to other people. With most xp coming from gp, players drop the "let's kill everything that moves" pretty fast, and wandering monsters become a sort of ticking clock (since they barely give xp but waste valuable party resources) that I find quite satisfying.</p>\n<p>There's no pre-made character histories, since most level 1 PCs die quite fast: after the culling, personalities and even backgrounds are slowly developed during play for the lucky ones that survive. But that's not the point, it's just icing on the cake. Making a meaningful story is not the point -- it's winning.

That said, I scrupulously award everyone the same XPs, even if they miss a session, to make sure no one falls behind. For me, as a player, the problem with levels and XPs is that most everyone starts out as a klutz with a very limited range of options. I don't mind the klutz so much but I don't want limits on what people might try to do. AD&amp;D to a certain extent gets round this problem by not providing rules for most things so I have informal systems for attempts to do anything else.<br/><br/>The other thing is that even if you're not terribly bothered about killing monsters and getting XPs, you can do plenty of other things that don't get in the way of levelling up. And because I don't care who actually does kill the monster, even those who spend much of their time doing something else still get the benefit of progression. In effect, everyone is being rewarded for what they are doing (although personally, I don't think much of the reward). So for people who want story and are prepared to bring it to the table, they get story. And we do have story and character play and development.<br/><br/>In the game where I'm a player, the place they've arrived at is pretty much the same but it's a very different route.

It's definitely not like most of the RPGs I've played in the last 2-3 years, but that's great. Not playing it for a few years has made it fresh and new, and reading an older version of the rules (I played Mentzer as a kid, I have Moldvay now) helps me read it with a fresh set of eyes. The simplicity of the rules combined with the explicit permission to do whatever makes sense makes it a fun as hell game.</p>\n<p>I'm a really busy guy and only have time for one RPG night a week. GMing D&amp;D gives me a chance to have some RPG fun outside of that, making dungeons when I have some free time.</p>\n<p>Before I say the next thing, I know it'll splash the water, and I apologize, especially given the thread so far. The burgeoning "old-school renaissance" community is still in its early phases of 'net recognition, which makes it inviting and fun, much like the first 12-18 months of the Forge forums. As communities on the Internet grow, they become toxic and un-fun until they split off again, and even then, nothing's guaranteed: forum Reavers will hunt their little ship through space. I'm really enjoying playing classic D&amp;D because the community surrounding it is still new, so it's nice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192075/#Comment_192075" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T07:34:14+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  7:34AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been playing <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://redbox.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">Old-Timey D&amp;D; pretty regularly for the past year</a> - any Story-Gamers in the NYC area are welcome any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great advantages of early D&amp;D; is that the expectations are extremely narrow and very clearly communicated.  The system works quite well for many incidental details (wandering monsters, light sources, etc.).  The game is challenging and fun, but the very informality of play means that it's okay for the DUNGEON MASTER to invent a new rule on the fly and everyone's okay with it.  The system is just present enough to be useful, but otherwise barely exists: you're almost, but not quite, free-forming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe severe downside of early D&amp;D; is that it is highly non-collaborative.  There is the Big Daddy DUNGEON MASTER who designs the setting, the situation, the other NPC's, the challenges, etc.  As a player, you design your fungible doomed hero and hope for the best.  This works, but the life-cycle of early D&amp;D; play is presumed to be rather long - we've been playing for almost a year, and <i>nobody has hit level 2</i> - and this means that there's a huge, and long-lasting, imbalance of creative forces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatest achievement of the indie RPG crowd is figuring out a way to distribute creative authority around the table.  It's a very good thing overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
