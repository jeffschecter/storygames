(Alternatively, here are <a href="http://catchyourhare.com/files/Cthulhu Dark booklet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Cthulhu Dark</a> and the <a href="http://catchyourhare.com/files/Dark Tales booklet.pdf" rel="nofollow">supplementary rules</a> in a format that's easier to print).  I used it to run my Trail of Cthulhu scenarios: The Dance In The Blood, The Watchers In The Sky and The Dying of St Margaret's. (By running established scenarios, I could focus on problems with Cthulhu Dark more easily).<br/><br/>So, Cthulhu Dark is really simple. It has two main rules.<br/><br/>1. Your Insanity starts at 1. Every time something scares your Investigator, roll your Insanity Die (a d6). If you get more than your current Insanity, increase your Insanity by 1. When Insanity reaches 6, you go mad.<br/><br/>2. To do something, roll one die if it's <i>within human capabilities</i> and another if it's <i>within your occupational expertise</i>. The highest die dictates how well you do.<br/><br/>First, I ran The Dance In The Blood. This is such a reliable scenario that it could hardly fail: if I'd run it with Paranoia, it would still have worked. The playtest was reassuring. I'd worried the players would want Call of Cthulhu-style skills, but they seemed happy with that "occupational expertise" die.<br/><br/>Also, Insanity worked nicely, creeping up slowly, with one Investigator going mad. The mechanic pushes everyone up to 4 or 5 Insanity quickly, then leaves them hanging around that level, until they suddenly snap.<br/><br/>Two rules surprised me. One, The Final Horror, felt wrong. It said: when you see the most horrific thing in the scenario (e.g. Cthulhu rising), the person with highest Insanity goes instantly mad. It felt completely unfair in play, like death by GM Fiat. Another rule, Suppressing Knowledge, felt more important than I'd thought. This said that, when your Insanity reaches 5, you can <i>decrease</i> your Insanity by suppressing Mythos knowledge: burning books, shooting yourself, shooting other Investigators. Everyone loved this.<br/><br/>The next night, I ran The Watchers In The Sky, a much harder scenario. It felt like hard work, with quiet players staring at me. Afterwards, however, they said they enjoyed it, and it was an excellent playtest: it showed up problems without totally falling apart. Again, Final Horror was wrong. Again, everyone loved Suppressing Knowledge.<br/><br/>On the final night of the con, I decided at the last minute to run The Dying Of St Margarets. It was a quiet slot: many people had left the convention and everyone remaining was tired. So I stripped it down and ran it in two hours: it felt like a ghost story. The players were fabulous. They'd spent the weekend playing Warhammer 40K and other traditional stuff. They took to the rules-light stuff beautifully.<br/><br/>One rule, which developed throughout the weekend, involved adding your Insanity Die as a third die when you wanted to do something. You get the picture: it gives you an extra die, meaning you're more likely to roll higher, but there's a risk of increasing your Insanity. The rule went through three stages:\n<ul>\n<li>If your Insanity Die ties with any other die you roll, your Insanity increases. It felt clunky.</li>\n<li>If your Insanity Die is the highest die, your Insanity increases. This felt like a disincentive: if your Insanity die was any use, your Insanity went up.</li>\n<li>If your Insanity Die is the highest die, you make an Insanity Roll. And that worked much better.</li>\n</ul>\nBy the end of the convention, it felt pretty solid. I'd use it to run new scenarios. (The question of how you design scenarios is still open.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310307/#Comment_310307" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T15:26:01+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  3:26PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite> if I'd run it with Paranoia, it would still have worked.</blockquote>\nNow, see, when I saw this, I was thinking, "Ooh, using Cthulhu Dark to run Paranoia? That's be cool!" Of course, three and a half seconds later, I realized you were talking about the scenario, and not the rules system.<br/><br/>But I like the way this has turned out so far, especially with how relatively minimalist it is, while still allowing for some great game play. I want to try this with a couple of my more narrative-friendly friends soon. I wonder, however, how combat would be handled against more mundane opponents. Sure, you run away or hide from the great big beasties, but how about the mortal cultists? Just run it like an opposed roll? Would you even track wounds, or would you just make them conditions a la Lady Blackbird?<br/><br/>...now that I think about it, these rules actually MAY work well with Paranoia. Instead of Insanity, you have Treason. The thought of it makes me somewhat giddy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310310/#Comment_310310" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T15:33:19+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  3:33PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By default, there are no combat rules.

Opponents die when their Harm gets to 3 or 4.<br/><br/>Treason!

For the guys I play with, some of them would balk at the idea they couldn't punch a cultist. Many of them have a history of making combat-inclined characters that are poorly suited to combat in CoC campaigns (taking such skills as Lasso...) At least, with this, I can allow them to feel somewhat...tough, perhaps until the point they encounter horrible things in the dark.<br/><br/>...and I am so hacking a version for Paranoia now.

That's one of CD's best insights, as I see it.<br/><br/>EDIT TO ADD: Wow, that sounds dismissive rather than enthusiastic and impressed, as I intended. What I mean is: Why are you punching the cultist? You want to stop the summoning, right? So deal with the sanity-blasting horror of the scene, then roll as usual to punch the cultist. If you succeed, you stop the summoning, and you play that out (maybe the dice indicated that you should hold steadfast in the face of the revelation, and, iron-willed, level the bad priest with a strength born from understanding the cosmic stakes... or maybe a berserk frenzy ensued, and when your guy regained consciousness, the ceremony was over, the world safe for one more day, but the blood... ). Otherwise, you don't stop the summoning, and the GM does his side of the scene. HP needn't enter into it! Instead, take a step back, articulate your intent in the terms the game provides, and let that shape the fiction - actualize the potential literature in this game, you know? It could be really cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310354/#Comment_310354" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T02:31:56+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  2:31AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2011 10:50AM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin has pretty much got it.

You can run or sneak (that's how Lovecraft brings excitement into his stories), but you'll never fight.<br/><br/>Now, sure, some groups like a pulpier style of play. Perhaps Cthulhu Dark can be hacked for that.<br/><br/>But those core rules focus on Insanity. Because that's the problem. Your physical well-being has little to do with it.

And I'm not sure whether rerolling is redundant. Does applying Insanity twice dilute it? You could use it as do the basic roll then decide whether to chuck in Insanity and risk to gain. That'd cover both bits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does feel like it needs a bit more attention to physical conflict. Perhaps monsters might be instantly lethal, but what about those cultists? You need to at least specify. I suppose you could say that all physical conflicts with ordinary people are resolved by intimidation, and it's a story conceit that they never go as far as actual violence. So an occupation of Boxer, say, would help to make you too scary for ordinary folk to trifle with, and you could narrate how that is demonstrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do use a Harm stat, you should definitely consider letting players risk it in the same way as Insanity. For some physical tasks, perhaps it might help if you're willing to strain a bit. You could say that if they want to leap from a train or fight crazed cultists, that *isn't* something ordinary people can do. You have to have a physical sort of occupation - which you might discourage or disallow for genre reasons, or allow for a pulpier game - or, for most characters, roll the Harm die. It's kind of an indicator of non-cinematicness. So you might end up with levels of physical action: trivial, dangerous (Harm) and lethal (auto-death). You'd also need to talk about what happens if you lose a physical conflict: presumably lose 1 Harm for minor ones or die for major ones.) ...or maybe junk all that and say that jumping off the roof of a train requires Insanity!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck spelling of R'lyeh!<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it practical to use your Insanity Die as a record when you have to keep rolling it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
