The <a href="http://www.benn.ca/muse" rel="nofollow">Free Edition</a> is still available. The Deluxe Edition came about in part thanks to help from members of this community. Thanks!<br/><br/>I'm planning on writing some sourcebooks, and maybe even some novels to go with Muse.<br/><br/>I've noticed that (I guess unsurprisingly) people tend to be a lot more interested in buying sourcebooks or interesting story concepts rather than generic rules. I'm toying with a few different ideas, but I'm curious if there are any unexplored ideas out there that you'd like to see?<br/><br/>--Jonathan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468499/#Comment_468499" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-17T19:56:40+00:00" title="December 17, 2017  7:56PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2017 8:03PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve only played Musette once so I\u2019m not sure how well this would work with Muse, but I would love to see a sourcebook that has options to explore and tell stories similar to Game of Thrones and Dune.

However, in my experience, I find that Muse and Musette both are really good at handling politics. The Questions mechanic lets you explore both sides of a conflict and then resolve when the situation is ripe. Of course, to achieve something as awesome as A Song of Ice and Fire or Dune will require a certain level of player skill, and probably some advance preparation too.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll take note of this... I won't be able to use those worlds directly without permission (which I am vanishingly unlikely to get), but I can try rolling some cool politics into the books I <i>am</i> writing.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote">What type of sourcebooks are you thinking about so far? I would likely be interested in a few different kinds.</blockquote>\nI've got two main ideas so far (both are working titles subject to change):<br/><br/><b>Winter's Children:</b> after a nuclear apocalypse that caused a devastating Nuclear Winter, humanity emerges from their isolation and tries to rebuild civilization. Humans (and animals) have mysterious psychic powers, which are how they survived the Winter. Some of the main themes in this book will be (1) How can we plan for recovering from a civilization-ending event? (2) Will those plans work? Are they even ethical and worth the cost? (3) Picking up the pieces, can we figure out what went wrong and stop it from happening again? (4) Understanding the perspectives of colonizing forces vs the current inhabitants. I'm also aiming for a mature theme, with believable ecology and politics.<br/><br/><b>Gnosis:</b> a low fantasy set in a place that seems like our world, but where magic is real and carefully hidden. The trick is that magic only works if everyone observing it believes it's real. There are tons of weird cults, each with their magical specialty, each vying against the others to try to discover the truth behind magic and the world. Meanwhile, a mysterious and powerful force, with an army of secretive angels and demons, tries to stop anyone that digs too deeply. Is the world we experience real? Or is it a veil over a deeper truth? How will we know when we've reached the final truth, or is there always a deeper secret?\n<blockquote class="Quote">I will also try to give you some more feedback once I read or play the full version.</blockquote>\nThanks!<br/><br/>--Jonathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468512/#Comment_468512" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-18T22:38:45+00:00" title="December 18, 2017 10:38PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2017 10:42PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool ideas!
