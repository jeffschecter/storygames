And I'm kept wondering.<br/><br/>That old <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11037l" rel="nofollow">What are you wearing</a> thread made me smile. I was kind of expecting the responses it got.<br/><br/>Now, I can't help but be curious. I feel it is more of a cultural (as in "country") stuff.<br/><br/>You see, I live in Mexico. I have met a big bunch of role players in my many years playing. And yet I have only met less than a handful of people who would fill the stereotype.<br/><br/>In fact my playing groups have only had a few of overweighted guys. And I'm talking "a couple of dozens of extra pounds", not "morbidly obese" or anything of the like. And we are talking about maybe around 3 out of 30. And I have the feeling that the percentage of overweight in gamers is about equivalent to the general population's overweightness in Mexico.<br/><br/>So my question is: Does the stereotype actually represents the majority in our hobby? Is it a cultural thing? Does it actually relates to the "jocks vs. nerds" stuff it seems prevalent in American media? How does it work in other (non USA) countries?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252076/#Comment_252076" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T11:53:06+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 11:53AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I'd say that it's definitely cultural. In the US the hobby selection process favours overweight seclusives (which are, note, already a much more common thing in the US than they are elsewhere), so that's what they mostly get. And because the US gamers represent the majority of roleplaying media and probably the majority of players as well, that US-specific thing gets interpreted as the picture of the hobby itself. I don't think I've ever seen this thing here in Finland as anything but a thin cultural loan from the US - the bitching about stereotypical fat gamers just rings hollow around here, and I should know as I'm superficially a pretty classic fatbeard type myself in many ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252079/#Comment_252079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T11:57:18+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 11:57AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Walking into an "open games day" event at my local game shop, I typically see a preponderance of folks with poor personal hygiene and very, very sloppy dress codes more than I see huge heavy dudes.

Overweight? That's "average" these days (especially on Match.com!). But I see quite a few skinny (myself included) and fit and sort of lumpy and even athletic.

While there are certainly younger and thinner gamers, especially around GW minis games, greyer and more pear-shaped does seem pretty common amongst minis gamers. A lot of the things that make minis gaming more viable are easier for an older, more settled lifestyle, which is when a lot of folks start to also experience the sudden appearance of a gut.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252092/#Comment_252092" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T12:33:19+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 12:33PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;I am willing to bet, however, that a comparative sampling of *computer gamers* versus LARPers and TTRPGers would show that the computer is far worse for you than the battle mat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot if you go by my totally scientific methodology of making assumptions based on The Guild.

It shouldn't surprise a statistician that there are more fat people in gaming than in marathon running - and not because running marathons makes you thin, but because your body can't hack the marathon if you're too fat. The same explanation seems believable for why there's more obesity among video gamers than roleplayers, even - get fat enough and you lose the self-confidence to meet up even with other fatties for gaming, leaving you to play alone.

It shouldn't surprise a statistician that there are more fat people in gaming than in marathon running - and not because running marathons makes you thin, but because your body can't hack the marathon if you're too fat. The same explanation seems believable for why there's more obesity among video gamers than roleplayers, even - get fat enough and you lose the self-confidence to meet up even with other fatties for gaming, leaving you to play alone. Get even fatter and playing video games is probably the only intellectual stimulation aside from reading that you<i>can</i>enjoy.</blockquote>\nI can only wonder...

But I guess these are the border cases.<br/><br/>I am about to attend a con and will make a mental note of the proportion of fat, bearded and unhygienic people I see there.  I'd say that here in the UK something like about 20% of people I see at cons are fat guys with beards.  Less than 10% of the people I meet smell like they haven't washed.  The rest are mostly somewhere between somewhat overweight and basically average.  Although thesea re the type of people who are willing to travel to a con, the demographic for more casual gamers may be quite different.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I am both quite fat and have a beard, although a more stylish one than most you see at these things.<br/><br/>Freakily, I have been complimented twice today without a hint of irony for smelling nice.

What's more, the proportions thereof are roughly representative of the proportion of the general populace that share the same body form. In other words, yes we have some big guys gaming but I see just as many big fat guys walking around the city.<br/><br/>My thought therefore would be this. Role-playing is associated with geekish behaviour. There are two basic body-forms for the classic geek, painfully thin and on the tubby side. Both often wear spectacles. The gamers you see on TV shows like the Simpsons will always be stereotypes because they want the reader to instantly associate them. The comic store guy in the Simpsons is probably the only role-player with a regular TV spot, other gamers in shows like Family Guy and Futurama notwithstanding. Therefore he has become the roleplaying zeitgeist in the popular media, whether he is an accurate representation or not. He's the only role-player that most non-gamers will knowingly come into contact with, so he is 'the' gamer to them, the one that defines the culture.<br/><br/>Which is bloody annoying because I HATE the guy!<br/><br/>This is just a theory of course. Your countries and experiences may differ.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
