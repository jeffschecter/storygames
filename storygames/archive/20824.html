I've come up with a simple little minigame in which they move across the battlefield addressing different threats and challenges, hoping to turn the tides. There are 13 threat locations, each of which has a countdown clock and will reduce their side's Morale by -1 if they ignore or fail to deal with them (as well as fictional consequences like the death of friendly NPCs). They may also have opportunities to increase Morale by +1 if they come up with ways to do so (inspiring speeches, etc.). So, my question is, <b>how many Morale points should they start with?</b> The sides are fairly evenly matched, and I want it to feel like there is a genuine risk of their side retreating, without making it impossible to "win." I was thinking 6, but I don't have the head for numbers/design to really evaluate the possibilities.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457169/#Comment_457169" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T01:49:18+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  1:49AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darn, I came in all eager to do a bit of math on my writing break, and then it's about some Dungeon World stuff I've no clue about <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>If each of those 13 threats succeeds or fails independently of the others, and you can manage to figure out the odds of each succeeding, then you can easily calculate how many failures will occur on average.

To be clear this little morale meta-system described above isn't connected to the mechanics of DW. Each location is a self contained encounter that can succeed or fail independently of the rest. You're right that the odds of success are the key factor... I'll have to think about it some more but given that they're level 10 characters I would say the odds of success are high, so maybe lower starting morale will be more evocative of a desperate battle...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457175/#Comment_457175" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T03:30:08+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  3:30AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will the characters really be able to engage every one of these 13 setpieces without having to make any compromises? If they can, and the odds of success are high for each (they don't need to like spread their resources thin or something like that), then they might not lose many morale points at all.<br/><br/>For example, if the odds of success per setpiece were 80% on average, that would mean that the army would lose an average of 0.2 morale points per setpiece, summing up to 2.6 points after 13 encounters. In this case an army with say 4 points to begin with would likely be just fine. But ultimately it all depends on the pass/fail odds of each individual threat.<br/><br/>When I game this sort of thing - and this might not be appropriate to DW at all - I tend to rely less on setpiece planning, and more on simulation (elegant simulation, note, but simulation nonetheless) of dynamic systems. For example, here I would probably not try to set the army's morale point score on the basis of my hoped-for battle outcome; rather, I might sit down with the players and ask them to list the morale factors of the army, and then grant it a +1 morale point for each factor, and whatever they end up with is what they'll have. So they'd maybe get a +1 for a cohesive force, a +1 for solid motivation, a +1 for desperation, or whatever. This might cause an army to get too few or too many points for the fight to become a nail-biting race to the finish, but there's the virtue that whether it proves too easy or too hard, the outcome has been thoroughly justified by the process: if we lost, it was probably because our army wasn't good enough, and vice versa.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457183/#Comment_457183" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T14:09:01+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:09PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2016 2:10PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good thoughts from Eero!<br/><br/>I'd be happy to help with the math, too, but there doesn't seem to be enough information in your blurb to actually do any math. We don't know what's happening, really, mathematically at all.<br/><br/>Not to mention that things like countdown clocks don't function mathematically at all... (a lot of resolution in a game like DW isn't exactly mathematically, um, approachable, since it relies so much on judgement calls made at the table, and so forth).<br/><br/>Given your setup as described, I'd say that the ratio of winning/losing Morale points will do more to shape your game than the other way around. (For instance, if the battle is desperate, the group will have to a lot more "making heroic speeches", or whatever you figure gives them more Morale, whereas if they have more than enough, then they will spend all their time attacking the threats.)<br/><br/>Having said that, 6 Morale sounds like a great place to start. If the odds are anywhere near 50/50 for each threat, it makes a close but uphill battle - perfect for a story of "heroism". You get enough points to compete, but not enough to guarantee victory without being lucky or clever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457185/#Comment_457185" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T14:21:39+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:21PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks both! Haha, yeah I think the fact that I consider this "math" probably says a lot about how ill-equipped I am to do this kind of design.<br/><br/>My plan right now is for each clock to have 6 "ticks"  before the bad stuff happens, and every clock will advance one tick each time they move to a new location (I originally thought 4 but that's too limiting). This is supposed to give them a sense of the battle inexorably proceeding with or without their intervention. So, there is a time limit on them securing the battlefield and (eventually) facing off against the big bad. So, it'll likely be impossible for them to deal with every single one of the threat - it's hard to say but I would guess they'll probably see about half of them before the battle ends one way or another. <br/><br/>Eero, I really like your idea about basing the starting Morale on the fictional readiness of the army! This actually gels with what I have planned already, but I hadn't thought of tying it directly to morale. I have six players, so if I give each player a chance to suggest a positive factor that their character can supervise or directly influence and roll on it with an appropriate skill, they'll probably end up with 3-5 starting morale, more or less justified by the fiction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457186/#Comment_457186" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T14:29:58+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:29PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>My plan right now is for each clock to have 6 "ticks"  before the bad stuff happens, and every clock will advance one tick each time they move to a new location<br/></blockquote>\nWell, that obviously doesn't work.

On each player turn the group can either a) move to a different location or b) attempt to solve the problem in the current location. (They should also be able to split up and whatever else, if I had my way.) On the GM turn the GM chooses <i>one</i> of the ongoing threats, advances its clock by one tick, and describes how that particular threat is becoming more imminent.<br/><br/>Given this design and assuming that the party doesn't split, but does succeed in dealing with each of the 13 threats with one action, the party will need a total of 26 actions to deal with all the threats. (13 actions for moving around and 13 for actually doing stuff.) As each threat clock has 6 ticks (I suggest having less, and having them vary between the clocks - an average of 4 is better says my gut), theoretically 3 of the threats can get through before the party has finished with the battle; in reality the party will obviously prioritize the threats that are the most advanced, and therefore none of the threats will get a chance to actualize before the party stomps them out.<br/><br/>To fix that, a further revision: instead of the GM advancing just one threat by one tick on their turn, have them roll for it. (Is this a taboo on AW games? I think it is...) On a 6- they advance just one threat, on 7-9 they advance two, and on 10+ they advance three. An uncertainty factor like this should give you the jittery firefighting feel that you're looking for, where the party is hurrying to and fro, dealing with issues as they come to the forefront.<br/><br/>(An alternate way to go would be to have the characters spend more "turns" per threat instead of giving the GM more ticks per. I would, however, prefer it if the party can basically shut down each threat in one "turn" of activity, as you have lots of threats and it's gonna get boring if each one has to be micromanaged with lots of dicing. You'll want quick resolution for each individual threat.)<br/><br/>Going even further, what I would have would be an overall battle progress meter of some sort, which advances inexorably regardless of the individual threats. The idea would be that this battle progress meter determines how many ticks the GM gets for the various threats per "battle round". Like, it could be so simple that the GM gets 1 tick on the first round, 2 on the second, and so on cumulatively. The characters can then spend time waging battle on this battle progress meter in "general melee", in addition to addressing the individual threats. Maybe you can reduce the meter by one point, or halve it, or halve-1 at most by one action - something like that. The party then needs to balance their time in the battle between addressing individual threats that are ticking down the most, while also making sure that the general flow of combat does not turn overwhelming on their side - being competent about the threats doesn't matter anymore once e.g. six ticks per exhange are raining down, causing an average of one threat to actualize each time they make a move.<br/><br/>Alternatively - and this is how I would do this in D&amp;D, relevant or not - one could just roll for each threat separately every "round" and see if they progress or not. Like, 1/3 for each, so you roll 13d6 and every result of 1-2 means that one of the threats ticks down - maybe every 1 ticks down twice, just to fuck them up even more. This sort of approach is good in that it keeps the situation very dynamic, but perhaps it's too chaotic for DW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457209/#Comment_457209" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T19:08:38+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  7:08PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Certainly there are many ways you could do this. We discussed some of them in the earlier "initiative' thread.<br/><br/>Other things which come to mind:<br/><br/>What if there were no "turns", strictly speaking?<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>* Clocks advance when players roll a miss, or neglect a "golden opportunity". Each roll can destroy a threat OR it could advance a threat, if you miss.<br/><br/>* Clocks advance simply based on their distance from a PC. This means that characters have to go to certain locations in order to "hold back" those threats. <br/><br/>Threats which go ignored for a long time eventually take place.<br/><br/>I like the feeling of mounting desperation this one could produce - on the first turn, you watch almost all the threats tick off one segment and it's terrifying! Later in the game, the PCs have spread out and have many of them under control, and just need to hunt down the few which are getting close to being triggered...<br/><br/>* Players can make as many moves/turns as they like. However, they have some kind of dwindling resource (perhaps Morale). Difficult events or failed moves cause Morale to fall. If Morale falls to 0, the battle is lost.<br/><br/>What you must do to keep fighting is to take non-combat actions (like a rest, or a rousing speech, or whatever is in-genre for your battle). <br/><br/>Each time you take a non-combat action, however, the MC/GM gets to advance some threats. So you're always balancing "how many things can we risk doing?" with threats advancing.<br/><br/>(You have to work out the numbers here just as you would for anything else. For instance, maybe it's based on the players rolling for their non-combat action - somewhat as Eero suggests, but more AW-like:<br/><br/>Raise Morale<br/>10+ You do it, and quickly! You're back in the battle.<br/>7-9 You raise the troops' Morale, but the MC can advance the clocks on up to half of remaining threats.<br/>6- The MC can advance the clocks on all but two threats.<br/><br/>Do you want more threats to advance faster, or do you want things to move more quickly when few threats remain? All important questions.)<br/><br/>Threats advancing could also be based on how many segments have been ticked.<br/><br/>Consider this:<br/><br/>On each turn, the MC rolls a d6.<br/><br/>What number did she roll? Any threat which is not being contested or held back could advance. Every such threat which does NOT yet have that many segments marked advances (mark one segment).<br/><br/>On the first turn, then, they all mark one segment. On the second turn, the PCs spread out, and remaining threats have a 5/6 chance of advancing.<br/><br/>However, as they get more and more desperate, they will advance more slowly.<br/><br/>Lots of options! Balancing this kind of system can be tricky, however. One way is to stick to a strict mathematical principle. (e.g. Every turn the players, as a group, have the opportunity to eliminate 0-2 threats, but on average 1. I have 10 threats, so I expect the game to be over after 10 turns, on average. I'd like for half of them to manifest, so I include a roll which gives me a 0.5 chance on any given turn of a threat manifesting...)<br/><br/>Another way would be to build something flexible into your system, so you can manipulate outcomes for maximum drama. This obviates the whole point of a fair contest but can allow whoever has that control to alter the tension of the conflict as it goes along. In a AW-based game, this could be allowing the MC to make a move anytime she wishes (so she can avoid doing so when the players are doing poorly, but do so often if they're doing well), or some other kind of rule, which, for example, rewards the players to give threats opportunities as often as possible (e.g. they gain experience based on how close the threats are to manifesting).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457243/#Comment_457243" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-19T02:07:36+00:00" title="October 19, 2016  2:07AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2016 2:08AM by Felan.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am so glad I started this thread, this would have been a goddamn mess otherwise!

Every such threat which does NOT yet have that many segments marked advances (mark one segment).<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457423/#Comment_457423" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-24T01:32:55+00:00" title="October 24, 2016  1:32AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2016 1:39AM by Felan.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played the first part of this epic battle today, and it went well! We did the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/457425/#Comment_457425" rel="nofollow">lead-up to the battle</a>, and then they tackled 2.5 threats (we had to stop in the middle of a skirmish due to time restrictions). The first couple of threats they chose just happened to be non-combat so it was a bit of a slow burn, but now they're fully in the crush and it's pretty exciting.<br/><br/>We set the starting Morale based on preparation rolls, which gave them 4, and during play they took the time to take in-fiction action to increase it to 5. It's plenty, and I think they'll be fine, but it feels appropriate to the fiction.<br/><br/>For the clocks, I ended up using Eero's idea about just rolling a 1/3 chance for each clock to advance each round. It's had the desired effect of creating a dynamic and unpredictable battlefield with a genuine risk of defeat, while also giving them a sense that each move they make is meaningful and has consequences.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your help with this! It made a big difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457424/#Comment_457424" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-24T01:38:12+00:00" title="October 24, 2016  1:38AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
