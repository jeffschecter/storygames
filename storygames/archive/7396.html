You are only allowed to touch certain parts of the body (arms, neck, hands). The first larp that used it tried to write as much or the method into the in-game truth, i.e., arms were eroticised etc. I think this is bad because it gives us less possibilities to use the places of the body we are allowed to touch as metaphorical places. I guess this is also a safety kind of thing, but not only.  <br/><br/>I am not sure how subsequent larps have handled this -- if they have used the method without rewriting the in-game truths about human (or space bedouine) sexuality or not. <br/><br/>In A Nice Evening with the Family, Elsa Helin used free form dance improv to simulate sex. For example, when Jean and Julie, two characters from a stage play that was incorporated in  the story, was having sex, she had the entire ensamble from that play perform the sex scene. The power in those scenes was incredible and, IMHO, you could play so much more in the freeform dance setting. People made the most wonderful expressions of status, power struggles, sexual climax, etc. in those scenes. And the level of touching could be very regulated and used to mean things in the scenes. <br/><br/>I think that human touch is an important concept in playing (and moreso in life of course). It helps establish high levels of intimacy and understanding \u2013 are we on the same page with this thing. <br/><br/>Also, there are differences in how touching is used in larp and role-playing (jeepform, table top etc.). In larp, you are more focussed on staying in character all the time and to preserve the illusion. If your story is about flirting with this girl, then you would (in the scandinavian scene) be expected to really kiss her in the end (if that's where the story is going). That requires a certain build-up (of trust, security, etc.) that is more rare in the kinds of stuff I do, since there is a lot of jumping between characters etc., and we use other means than character immersion to create heart-felt experiences. I cannot remember kissing a girl on the mouth in table-top or jeepform games. <br/><br/>Not having read Ghosts (but now knowing what to read for breakfast) I think that one should be catious to link touching to resolution rules. To my mind, there is something honest about touching, and if you rewrite its semantics, you might end up with a bad case of mindfuck. <br/><br/>In a lot of scandinavian larps, it is not uncommon to include trust-building exercises where touching is an integral part in preparing for a game. This helps to defuse touching and subsequently lower its barrier. In playing Under My Skin at GenCon, Emily and I had the seven of us do a group hug before playing for these very reasons. Even better would have been to have everyone hug everyone, but we were short for time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164589/#Comment_164589" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T10:40:43+00:00" title="August 23, 2008 10:40AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 11:17AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am interested in tactile game-components too, and have done some foraging into the field. Some of my roleplaying poetry has tactile elements (thouching feet, holding hands, etc.). The fact that we all respond automatically to touch makes it a very interesting and potentially effective tool for immersing players in the fiction.<br/><br/>I am not content to do this as experiments alone, but aim to educate myself in the science of touch and to organize my knowledge in a way that makes it a workable design-tool for me in future RPG-design. I feel that it is essential to my artistic goal: <i>life-changing games</i>.<br/><br/>I used touch in my classical FRPG <b>Fabula </b>some years ago. It was linked to a central NPC in a convention-scenario. The NPC was a brain-damaged young man who was destined to follow the characters on their quest to save their village. The GMs were instructed to use touch as part of the bonding between the NPC and the characters during the game. This was done to make the finale effective. The group had to bring a goat to a mountain top, deep into the wild range of <i>The Dragon Mountains</i>. The goat was meant to be sacrificed there, to save the village.<br/><br/>It was part of the scenario that a dragon would take the goat from the characters, thus leaving them without their sacrifice. Of course: the NPC was destined to sacrifice himself on the altar. That was the preplanned finale. To make that ending work we had to knit very strong bonds between him and the characters (really: the players). To let him (the GM) touch them (the players) in all kinds of kind ways during the gameplay was our method for doing this. The idiot insisted on holding hands, standing behind others and holding their shoulders in danger, giving hugs, fiddling with their sleeves, touching nose (particularly fond of that, wiggling his nose so that their eyes went up and down, laughing himself crazy each time), sleeping close with them (the GM sitting shoulder to shoulder with another player), etc.<br/><br/>It worked. Even though all the touching was akward for most players, it made them bond with the NPC. They had to accept his touch and forgive him the impropriety, due to his brain-damage. He was an enthusiastic fool, the village idiot, and very fond of them all. He had no other way of showing his joy and love for them.<br/><br/>The groups playing this scenario all found the last scene to be unbelievably touching (no pun intended). The emotional bonds created during the scenario were too heavy to be neglected in the dramatic finale. The idiot placed himself on the altar, and explained that of course <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he</span> had to be sacrificed, due to him being the idiot. All the others had work to do, or families to tend. He had no work and no dependants. He said something like this: <i>Please! You are my friends! You can help me, so I can save the village! The elders said WE could save the village! WE! I am a part of WE! So I must save the village! You see? I am right! I have to sacrificed!</i><br/><br/>When the GM finally laid himself on his back, as the idiot, on the table, and told the players to indicate with their fingers how they cut his wrists (not his throat, due to him being afraid of loosing his voice in the afterlife) ... when that happened, the players where deeply touched. They were openly crying as they "slit" his wrists. They stood around him in a circle, held his hands, comforted him when he felt cold and listened to him talking of "the darkness that is coming". When the GM slumped and "died" the players still held on to his hands, or kept their hands under his head or on his breast (over his heart). The sacrifice of the idiot was a scene bigger than life, a moment of pure sorrow and beauty.<br/><br/>This scenario showed me with total clarity that <b>touch is a potential tool for beauty in roleplaying games</b>.<br/><br/>Jason: we DO have to meet sometime!

Without the kind touch we loose something essential. A social life without touch is deprived of one of its most efficient means of bringing good emotions to life in us. Good emotions are happiness and healing.<br/><br/>The fact that we depend on touch and respond to it instinctively makes it all the more effective as a game tool.<br/><br/><i>Sidenote:<br/>For a live roleplaying game to have rules against all kinds of touching, like the Camarilla has, sounds absurd to me, at least as long as it is not dictated by the game fiction. The only reason to make rules that bar participants from touching in everyday manners, would be to make a dystopia on estrangement and cynicism. If the Camarilla has this rule to avoid law-suits you need to rethink your judicial system. To let laws dictate such  fiendish and vilifying practices sounds really disturbed to me. You need to undo laws that makes ordinary touch a risk. Really: what kind of society have you Americans made for yourself ???<br/><br/>To have rules against full contact in fights and sex is natural, of course.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164653/#Comment_164653" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T17:00:17+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  5:00PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 5:00PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A game with players touching, recently posted here:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7211&amp;page" rel="nofollow"><b>The Rain</b></a> (a game of life and love)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164674/#Comment_164674" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T19:06:56+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  7:06PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><i>Sidenote:<br/>For a live roleplaying game to have rules against all kinds of touching, like the Camarilla has, sounds absurd to me, at least as long as it is not dictated by the game fiction.

Many methods require no touching at all (see <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=408591" rel="nofollow">the thread</a>).<br/><br/>I think one could make much of touching oneself (oh, stop it!), some of which might even have meaningful mechanical impacts. As a fast example, imagine something like Jungle Speed (grab the widget at a specific cue) but your hands are knitted behind your head (if at a disadvantage) or on your chest (minor disadvantage) versus flat on the table, near the widget.<br/><br/>Just spitballing, here (literally, it turns out): what about a mechanic where "helping dice" are only provided by people holding hands with you (which should also make a natural restriction of only one... assuming you need the other hand to roll... hehe... or get two helping dice if you spit them (which means someone has to put them in your mouth for you)).<br/><br/>Consider also the natural, real-life results of some touching: cover eyes, ears, or mouth to prevent sight, hearing, or speech. Holding a hand or wrist can prevent writing or rolling (maybe a "prevent" mechanic?). Holding hair or chin can prevent head motion--stuff like that.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just saying there are non-sensual ways to employ touch which wouldn't necessarily become "creepy" or even seem odd, if knitted well to the system and not merely a gimmick that's easily drifted or hacked out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_165358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165358/#Comment_165358" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:20:09+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:20PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, David!

Puritian attitudes about contact, from casual to sexual, permeate American society, and I personally think it's unfortunate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_166905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166905/#Comment_166905" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T23:47:58+00:00" title="September  3, 2008 11:47PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe the puritan attitude you talk about, Jarrod, is far from the explanation of this difference. The Nordic countries is as puritan as the US, and still we have more relaxed attitudes in this field.<br/><br/>My way of understanding how this difference has emerged, has to do with your political and artistic history. I believe the US have created a culture that has sexualized touch to the degree that normal touch has become dangerous. That is, of course, putting it a bit strong, but I do believe you need to look for explanations in other arenas that the purely religious one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166933/#Comment_166933" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T07:13:28+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  7:13AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, the U.S. is just too darn big to generalize that way.<br/><br/>There are a lot of religious groups here where non-sexualized touching is very commonplace (yes, even among some notoriously sex-phobic evangelical groups).  The same can be said for criminal gangs, athletic organizations, neighborhoods, music fans, and...well, just about any kind of group, really.  Primates, you know.  Using touch as a means of socialization just goes with the turf.<br/><br/>And likewise, there are groups where touching <i>is</i> discouraged, too, or is indicative of a deeper level of intimacy (and therefore inappropriate with people who you do not choose to be that close to).  But I don't see any evidence that more touchy-feely social groups are less common in the U.S. than more standoffish ones, and I say that as a guy who really doesn't like being touched by strangers.  (Although I do think that the "don't touch me" attitude might very well be more common on the internet than it is in real life -- if only because there's no better place to have a conversation where you <i>know</i> the other person isn't going to even <i>see</i> you, let alone be able to put their hand on you.  The rest of the country is hardly like the internet, though.)<br/><br/>It's safe to say that people in the U.S. like to stand farther apart from each other when talking than, say, people in Mexico...but going from that to "normal touch has become dangerous" is a huge leap, not at all supported by what you'd see if you actually looked at how people interact over here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166936/#Comment_166936" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T07:34:20+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  7:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Actually, the U.S. is just too darn big to generalize that way.<br/></blockquote>\nPlus, at least one of the more vocal people to have a reaction to touch-based mechanics (that would be me, btw), doesn't come from the US. But I doubt the sample size we're looking at here (participants of the touch threads) is big enough to draw any meaningful conclusions of this sort anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
