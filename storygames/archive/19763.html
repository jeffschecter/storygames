Some things here look "Yeah, duh, it's right there in the DMG" and some look "What, no, the DMG contradicts that".<br/><br/><br/>OK, so I loved Fate. When it first came out, I was playing Fudge and I was like \u201cUh, Fate, what is this? I don\u2019t get it\u201d. When SotC came out a few years later, I first didn\u2019t give it a closer look but as the hype grew, I gave it a try GM:ing it and I did like it. I bought Diaspora and it made us happy for a few sessions. Fate Core fixed everything that hadn\u2019t really worked with Diaspora. Now Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e is here and it has a few features that look a bit like Fate. Does it improve on it? Yes, I think so.<br/><br/><b>Character Aspects</b><br/>As Fate evolved, it evolved from a list of ten generic aspects into five specific aspects \u201cHigh Concept\u201d, \u201cTrouble\u201d, etc.<br/>5e\u2019s character traits are pretty much straight out of latest Fate. It sorta downplays them, which makes sense \u2014 they can come into play when players are familiar with the basic gameplay of d20 + mod &gt;= AC/DC. And they also don\u2019t have to come into play at all \u2014 the game flows and works very well without them being used.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve mentioned earlier how I\u2019ve had many players being confused with the difference between skills and aspects in Fate. That seems like way less of an issue here.<br/><br/>And I guess it downplays them in order to look more like \u201cGood old D&amp;D\u201d and less like \u201cFatey weird newstyle D&amp;D\u201d. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s a big deal for us who were already on board with Fate and weirdness.<br/><br/><b>Getting inspiration vs Being compelled</b><br/>I\u2019ve mentioned earlier an experience with Fate similar to this scenario:<br/>\u201cYour character has the aspect: \u2018Always looking for a fix\u2019, now here you are in a new city \u2014 don\u2019t you want to go look for a new dealer?\u201d<br/>and the player would go \u201cNo, I\u2019ll buy off the compel\u201d. And that\u2019s usually what happened \u2014 they bought off every compel. They used Fate points, but relied very heavily on the refresh at the beginning of every session.<br/><br/>With 5e, there\u2019s no need to buy off because you aren\u2019t explicitly compelled in the same way. Following the characteristics into trouble is something the players do or don\u2019t do themselves.<br/><br/>Fate Core\u2019s compels also have a weird situation going where they\u2019re sometimes phrased like this:\n<blockquote>You have ____ aspect in ____ situation, so it makes sense that you\u2019d decide to ____. This goes wrong when ____ happens.</blockquote>\nThe frustrating part about that, to me, is that you get or pay the Fate point when you make the decision in the first sentence. If it will go or would\u2019ve gone wrong in the second sentence. I don\u2019t mind the author stance but I can\u2019t see the future and it\u2019s especially hard to communicate the future. The post hoc nature of 5e\u2019s inspiration enables me to give the inspiration after it has gone wrong.<br/><br/>Of course, a lot of the time it\u2019s\n<blockquote>You have ____ characteristic in ____ situation, so it makes sense that you\u2019d decide to ____. But if you didn\u2019t have the characteristic, <em>not</em> doing that would\u2019ve made much more sense because it\u2019s a dangerous or sub-optimal decision, it\u2019s only because of the characteristic that you do it.</blockquote>\nThose are situations that would easily result in inspiration in 5e or a player-initatied compel Fate point awarded in Fate.<br/>What\u2019s called \u201cretroactive compels\u201d (and allowed) in Fate can kind of be the norm in 5e. In both games, you get awarded for being true to your character when it conflicts with your inner \u201ccompetitive game player\u201d.<br/><br/>But the two major types of compels in Fate Core are events and decisions.<br/>Decisions are the weird, almost dependent on precognition compels suggested in the quoted template above.<br/>Events are more like \u201cbad things happen to you because of your aspect\u201d. When \u201cbad things happen\u201d is something that\u2019s a little strange in D&amp;D, historically, compared to PbtA and Fate. The DM had to be a fair judge and not just be all \u201crocks fall everyone dies\u201d whereas in Fate the voice of narration is more distributed \u2014 this could just as well be something the player initiated: \u201cI have the aspect \u2611 <b><i>Allergic to Falling Rocks</i></b> so it makes sense that unfortunately, some falling rocks would hinder me in this situation.\u201d<br/><br/>In our latest 5e game, one player had the bond \u201cI will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival\u201d. The related \u201cevent\u201d was that this rival appeared and was up to shenanigans. That, in itself, didn\u2019t lead to inspiration. It was only the players own subsequent actions that lead to inspiration.<br/><br/><b>It\u2019s the Economy, My Friend</b><br/>It was always hard to get a good sweet spot between \u201cHaving too many Fate points and every roll becomes like +8\u201d and \u201cHaving no Fate points and not being able to interact meaningfully with most of the game mechanics\u201d. The economy was fragile. I sometimes would ponder solutions to this problem but nothing struck me as good.<br/>When I saw 5e\u2019s solution of having a cap at just one, my jaw dropped. After all the ideas I pondered, I had never been close to this genius idea. Felt like a Gordian knot being cut in front of my eyes.<br/>No economy not only means no distracting meta-game, it also means that you never leave the sweet spot.<br/><br/><b>Scene Elements</b><br/>Of course, part of what makes this binary non-economy work is that a lot fewer of the mechanical interactions are fueled by the resource in question.<br/>In Fate, you can spend fate points to invoke scene aspects to get advantage. In 5e, you just get advantage straight up, if it makes sense in the fiction.<br/>It\u2019s also a question of templating or wording.<br/><br/>In Fate, a scene would be described as: \u201cYou enter the room. There are some  \u2611 <b><i>Huge Unlabeled Crates</i></b> here, and there are some nasty \u2611 <b><i>Chains Hanging From the Ceiling</i></b>.\u201d<br/>You can interact with these elements mechanically (by invoking them as aspects), which is great because it gives a feeling of tangibility to the scene elements.<br/>But really there\u2019s nothing special about them. The same room description could easily be followed up with the exchange \u201cWhat about the floor, is it slippery?\u201d \u201cOh, the \u2611 <b><i>Floor Is Slippery</i></b>, for sure!\u201d The game is clear that the labeled, aspected game elements aren\u2019t the be-all, end-all of what\u2019s in a scene.<br/><br/>This feature of the game affords a few really appealing game examples, like \u201cI try light their jacket on fire\u201d \u201cOK, that\u2019s <em>Create an Advantage</em> into \u2610 <b><i>Jacket is Burning</i></b>, which you have a free invocation on.\u201d, examples that seems to work well and model the world well, in a sort of Lego piece fashion. But as appealing and smooth-flowing it often it, it also seems that a lot of the time the system is getting more in the way, making it hard to phrase exactly what\u2019s going on.<br/><br/>In 5e, the description would be more like \u201cYou enter the room. There are some huge unlabeled crates here, and there are some nasty chains hanging from the ceiling.\u201d You work within the fiction and when it makes narrative sense, you do get mechanical advantage in a consistent and easy way. It\u2019s decoupled from specific scene elements and it\u2019s decoupled from a character-specific economy.<br/>With Fate, if you\u2019re good at following The Golden Rule and The Silver Rule (<cite>Fate Core</cite>, p185), you are already working fiction first and then translating that into mechanical elements as needed. The problem I had with this was that I would either be bad at following these metallic rules and let the game mechanics get in the way of diegetic, narrative sense, or I would follow them too well, and forget about the game mechanics and drift off into mere narration (often to the detriment of the experience as a whole).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438417/#Comment_438417" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T06:20:08+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  6:20AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Using Inspiration</b><br/>This is something that\u2019s still a bit unclear. I\u2019ve seen in places that, when you use inspiration, it should be when you\u2019re doing something related to the characteristics, just like you invoke character aspects in Fate. That\u2019s not in the PHB, though, and my experience so far has been that it\u2019s good to just let it be used whenever. Now that the game doesn\u2019t have a fragile economy, it\u2019s good to just let it flow freely.<br/><br/>In Fate, you alse need to invoke your aspects in order to channel the fate points into bonuses on the rolls. This is something that I\u2019ve seen cause many beginners to tangle up what\u2019s \u201cskills\u201d and what\u2019s \u201caspects\u201d. It\u2019s also yet another coupling between the economy and your character\u2019s traits.<br/><br/>It\u2019s also cool to be able to give inspirations between players. The example that someone posted here was \u201cParty rogue makes a bad impression at the court, gets insp, gives it to the party bard that uses it to clean up the mess\u201d. That\u2019s a cool little interaction right there, but I have to be careful so I don\u2019t fall into the \u201cJacket is Burning\u201d-trap of a few situations very well modelled that gives a false impression of a generalizable rule. Instead, I\u2019ll just say that if inspiration is supposed to be a reward, especially a reward for things that put the whole party in trouble, it make sense that the reward benefits the whole party.<br/><br/>Player\u2019s can also reward each other for any reason they wish, such as a cool speech or interesting idea, but this is one of the few spaces where the non-stackable nature of Inspiration gets in the way. If you play to your characteristics to get inspiration as soon as you lose it, you won\u2019t have any space left to be rewarded by other players.<br/><br/>One oft-houseruled difference between 5e and Fate is that you need to use inspiration before you roll. I can respect changing that but I\u2019m going to try playing the 5e way for a while. I think the rolls get devalued and the tension deflated if you can just change it after the fact. But that\u2019s just me.<br/><br/><b>Spending the Fate points</b><br/>To summarize or rephrase the ideas in this post...<br/>Looking at Fate Core, you can spend fate points to<br/><br/>\u2022 Invoke one of your own aspects<br/>\u2022 Invoke another aspect<br/>These are gone in 5e. If there are elements in the fiction that gives you advantage, you just... get advantage. No points needed.<br/>In Fate Core, this is the most \u201creward-like\u201d use of Fate Points and the use that\u2019s most similar to 5e\u2019s inspiration. But it\u2019s coupled \u2014 your aspects give you the points and your aspects are used to use the points.<br/>If you want to use that reward in 5e, you just use your inspiration. Typically when you <em>don\u2019t</em> have in-fiction advantage, because it doesn\u2019t stack.<br/><br/>\u2022 Power a stunt<br/>Many of the player characters have their own weird little currencies in 5e (so we\u2019re getting back to the problems of fragile economies \u2014 oh, well, you can\u2019t win \u2018em all). In Basic, examples include the \u201cslots\u201d that the wizard and the cleric gets, or the \u201cshort rest\u201d that powers the fighter\u2019s Second Wind and Action Surge abilities as well as the wizard\u2019s Arcane Recovery meta-ability.<br/>In Fate, this is yet another use of Fate Points, creating a simpler game but a more highly coupled system.<br/><br/>\u2022 Refuse a compel<br/>As I\u2019ve said, this one led to problems in my group. It\u2019s free in 5e which I think increases player agency. I\u2019m happy about this change.<br/><br/>\u2022 Compel another character<br/>This one was always something I could understand, but not truly grok. A player compelling an NPC that \u201cthey can\u2019t make their move due to the \u2611 <b><i>Suppressive Fire</i></b>\u201d helps the Lego piece modelling somewhat, by being the flipside of the bonuses that invoking aspects give, but it\u2019s weird. Can the NPC refuse the compel? \u201cWe\u2019re brave, we cross the fire\u201d (and they pay a fate point). This isn\u2019t in 5e.<br/><br/>\u2022 Declare a story detail<br/>Here\u2019s another weird one. If you\u2019re telling the story together, a system where a player can spend a meta-game resource in order to affect the story is like a drop in the ocean. And if you\u2019re using a traditional actor stance, this is like a big wrench in the gears. Which can be just what the doctor ordered, sometimes, but there\u2019s still a lot of restrictions. You have to convince the GM that it make sense and they have the right to veto.<br/>So in any game without this rule: You can suggest a detail and the GM can accept or reject your idea.<br/>In Fate: You can suggest a detail and the GM can accept or reject your idea. If the GM accepts, you lose a fate point.<br/><br/>Rules for players doing what has been traditionally relegated to the GM is something we haven\u2019t seen yet in 5e. It\u2019s not part of the Basic core but it\u2019s been promised in an old Legends &amp; Lore article to appear in the DMG as an optional module. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing what they come up with.<br/>Being pessimistic, it\u2019s probably just another ocean-drop/wrench mechanic like Fate\u2019s \u201cdeclare a detail\u201d or it\u2019s been dropped altogether from the DMG in the space and time crunch as the release grows nearer.<br/>But we\u2019ll see, it might be good.<br/><br/><b>Overall System Design</b><br/>I\u2019ve mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)" rel="nofollow">coupling and decoupling</a> a few times in this post. They\u2019re interesting ideas from programming that\u2019s basically this:<br/><br/>A highly coupled system has the parts really depend tightly on each other. If one part breaks, the others will too, and it\u2019s harder to replace parts. A change in one will cause a ripple effect in the whole system.<br/><br/>So one way to look at it is:<br/>\u201c5e is a redundant, complex, almost bloated system whereas Fate Core is simple, doesn\u2019t repeat itself, and reuses solutions.\u201d<br/>Another way to look at it is:<br/>\u201cFate Core is highly coupled and is a fragile system where many of its parts are dependant on the same economy to flow smoothly. 5e is decoupled and robust.\u201d<br/><br/>Writing this post reminds me that the creators of 5e are all programmers (and so is, if I remember correctly, many of the folks behind Fate Core, right?). I love 5e.<br/><br/>It also makes me think that maybe the connection between Fate and 5e is weaker than I thought. There are so many differences.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438439/#Comment_438439" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T10:09:54+00:00" title="September 17, 2014 10:09AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great analysis.

Even looking at some of the examples of play in Diaspora, the game seems unsatisfying at spots (such as the huge political party struggle example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438654/#Comment_438654" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-24T07:16:30+00:00" title="September 24, 2014  7:16AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In this particular setup, players were pretty galvanized in a few particular conflicts already.

First of all, there's less of a feelbad for declined compels. In Fate, the GM offers a compel, the characteer declines, both feel bad. The GM because they feel they should've made a better offer, the player because they feel they should've written a better aspect (and because they lose a point). (And sometimes there are player iniated compels and that's awesome.) In 5e, most of the inspiring things <em>come from the player</em>. There's no feelbad. There's no punishment for it not being accepted. There's no pressure for the DM to come up with compelling hooks. Just prep a game as usual, as per Moldvay/Mentzer and rock out. In a group that dig on the characteristics, the inspiration will fly. If they don't, the game works great anyway since it's not coupled to important economies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438696/#Comment_438696" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-25T11:04:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2014 11:04AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno; I feel like you are broadening things unnecessarily here. <br/><br/>I don't think it's safe to say that Inspiration is super great and easy and no hard feelings just because it's 'self inflicted'.  What if you have someone who's not really good at this, but would cheerfully accept compels if only he could come up with some good ideas? There's no mechanism here for giving others the option to introduce things for someone else's character.<br/><br/>I guess it comes down to:  Is it communal storytelling where players have input on what happens to each other's characters, because the more people you have thinking about something, the more creativity you get, or is it about protecting feelings and giving each person a "private space" around their character where no one else can make them feel bad for not doing something?<br/><br/>I don't think either of these is "better" than the other, but I feel like you are painting an incomplete picture with your "And now, no one needs to feel bad!" position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438709/#Comment_438709" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-25T22:39:28+00:00" title="September 25, 2014 10:39PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone's not good at it, the game still works as D&amp;D. Interact with the sandbox prep, tag a with the group, shoot with your bow -- it doesn't "put you on the spot" as much as Fate can do, but it allows it, so how much creative effort you put into the gate can vary with your mood.<br/><br/>As for the communal story-telling pieces (supposedly in the DMG); we haven't seen them yet and for all we know, they might've been dropped, or might be bad. But that's yet another thing that's, in Fate, meshed up with the same economy that fuels everything else.<br/><br/>Highlighting this difference was the point of my post. That Fate uses one coherent system for many disparate things, which D&amp;D 5e separates out. Both approaches have things that are cool about them. I like D&amp;D's approach better and I thought that was interesting from a systems design perspective.<br/><br/>It's like the old "Worse is better" debate in systems design.

The DM was empowered to reward or punish characters for breaking their concept -- as defined by the DM using those simple tools (alignment and class, e.g.). <br/><br/>Rewards and punishment usually consisted of experience points; violating your chosen alignment could see you stripped of a level even if you weren't a paladin,  and 2e added explicit rules for rewards based on your class functions. (A rogue, for example, gains extra XP by stealing things of value -- so if you chose to play your rogue as a scout or investigator, you might miss out on bonus XP.)<br/><br/>Like other games of its era,  earlier (but not OD&amp;D games) sometimes adopted rewards for just "roleplaying well," where this was something rarely defined but seemingly having to do with both a combination of your character's personality and how the DM, as the (presumably impartial) judge, felt you roleplayed. Thus in addition to running the opposition, building the world, and in some cases setting up the story plot,  the DM also took on the job of RP critic.<br/><br/>Inspiration follows this pattern,  at least as presented in the PHB, of making a tangible reward given by the DM for "roleplaying your character well." The DMG may offer additional insight,  but for now the rule is simply that if the DM thinks your roleplaying is acceptable,  you can be rewarded with Inspiration (if you don't already have it). There is no actual requirement that your roleplaying reflects any of your BIFTs -- bonds, ideals, faults, or (personality) traits -- although those are mentioned vaguely in passing during the discussion of inspiration. <br/><br/>BITFs are not things that can be compelled one way or another;  they are simply guides to roleplaying the character's personality. Apart from pregen characters or players irrationally forced by their DM to roll randomly,  BIFTs are all self-chosen by the player and reflect how she is intending to play her character. <br/><br/>Thus, Inspiration awarded simply for playing out one's BIFTs is essentially a reward for doing what you said you were going to do.  There is no requirement for Inspiration that you actually make things worse for yourself in order to play out a BIFT; you are not being rewarded for taking a temporary setback, but merely for following what it says on your character sheet. <br/><br/>"I am faithful to my friends and would never desert them" could be a bond,  one of the BIFT types. You would choose this if, presumably, that is the way you want to play your character.  And because that's how you want to play your character, you could get rewarded with Inspiration for playing that out, if you have a DM who chooses to reward for BIFTs. You can't ever be forced to be faithful to your friends,  and the game never really proposes a coercive DM who, Fate-style, offers you a bribe of Inspiration if you decide to stay instead of desert.<br/><br/>Of course,  as noted before,  there is only a tenuous connection between Inspiration and BIFTs in the RAW. Many DMs may not even know what the BIFTs are at their table and there is no suggestion that the DM should track them.  In a party of 5 players,  that comes to 25 BIFTs total,  all of which are one or two sentences,  adding a burden to each RP interaction of not only running NPCs but also discerning whether a player is playing out one of her BIFTs or not -- unless she already has Inspiration,  in which case the point is moot because she can't earn it twice. <br/><br/>5e offers no mechanic or ritual phrasing by which the player can communicate to the DM and the other players that she is engaging with her BIFTs in order to gain Inspiration. Lacking such a cue, this leaves the player either hoping she was unsubtle enough that her RP was identified as an attempt to earn Inspiration, or she can speak up after the fact to point out that her just-concluded roleplay interaction was based on the hope of gaining a reward.  Either scenario is fraught with problems and can make it less appealing to players and DMs alike to play with Inspiration as a clear-cut mechanical reward for roleplaying BIFTs. <br/><br/>This,  then,  leaves BIFTs as a reward given simply for interesting RP, where interesting means "the DM chose to give it to me." Unlike a fan mail mechanic, all Inspiration originates with the DM; players can semi-freely trade it among themselves but they are not creating more Inspiration,  just passing it around the table. In theory the players can only exchange inspiration when impressed with someone else's game play, but it's unclear how this is adjucated. If the DM's approval or consent is needed then it raises the question of why the DM isn't simply rewarding the RP herself with new,  instead of traded, Inspiration. And yet if the DM's tacit approval is not required, then it seems players can freely trade Inspiration without concern as to whether it was legitimately "earned," e.g. for tactical reasons instead. "I'll go out and be kind to that peasant,  then give you my Inspiration so you can get advantage on the Deception check to bluff the guards."<br/><br/>My point of this long post (which seems longer because I am writing it on my phone) is not to say that Inspiration is a bad mechanic,  or a good one.  But rather to examine how it actually works without burdening it with assumptions that it is a Fate-style storygame-esque mechanic,  when really it's a DM-originated reward for the always vaguely defined concept of "good roleplaying." If BIFTs are included in a table's implementation of Inspiration, that reward is, in essence, a reward for playing your character as you said you were going to play your character.  Which is actually a really weak mechanic for encouraging depth in roleplay -- but for a game like D&amp;D, it may be about the best that you could expect based on the history and legacy of the game. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438748/#Comment_438748" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-27T02:31:36+00:00" title="September 27, 2014  2:31AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS: Although it's a side point,  I will also add that Inspiration is of limited use to some character types. <br/><br/>Inspiration can be used to gain advantage on an attack, saving throw,  or ability check/skill roll.  For a rogue,  having advantage can be great because their sneak attack bonus damage can be applied when they have advantage on an attack. But it's no help for a wizard who casts spells that require saving throws from her target -- you can't use Inspiration to apply disadvantage on someone else's roll. (One player of a wizard character told me that he had Inspiration from a previous game session and went for six sessions without even using it.)<br/><br/>Now presumably the wizard could be gaining Inspiration through good roleplay and constantly hands it over to the thief to make backstabs,  but I am not sure that really is the intent of the rules (although it's perfectly permissible under RAW). I do wonder if that would really be fun for anyone at the table, and if not then perhaps the consequences of the rules need to be examined more closely. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438749/#Comment_438749" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-27T02:40:59+00:00" title="September 27, 2014  2:40AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2014 2:48AM by 2097.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, great post, Caoimhe.<br/>My thoughts:<br/>Yuck for all of those "you have pleased the GM" Dog Show rules in RPG:s over the years.

And there is support in the book for DMs who want to use Inspiration that way, you're right, and that's been a concern of mine ever since it was previewed in L&amp;L.<br/><br/>The missing cue or ritual phrase? I really miss it and have missed it. We started using "That gives me inspiration, right?" and that was part of what made it work. Before we had that, it sucked. I've talked about this to, in other threads. This is something I missed from 5e as written.<br/><br/>The reason I spun this one out on its own was that I wanted to look at all the things fate points do, as a whole, break them down and see how 5e solved the same problems.

I haven't figured out which I am going to use. Maybe a combination of both. <br/><br/>First, Inspiration is given on the honor system and not a reward from the DM. There is a bowl of Inspiration tokens (glass beads or poker chips) in the middle of the table.  If you,  as a player,  play out one of your BIFTs and you think you did a good job -- and you don't already have Inspiration -- then you can just reach out and take a token.  You are the one who chose or wrote your BIFTs; ergo you know what they mean and can judge if you are playing it out,  not the DM.<br/><br/>Second idea, Inspiration is only given when one of your BIFTs or other roleplaying causes you difficulty on a roll.  This is represented by you choosing to gain disadvantage on a roll,  which you do not already have disadvantage on. Once you do that,  you gain Inspiration. <br/><br/>The first is more fluffy and means lots of advantage probably,  and also relies on players being able to self-judge and not start arguments with each other.  The second is purely mechanical and forces players to look for ways to gain disadvantage with the goal of gaining advantage in the future -- it is closer to the idea of a Fate compel in that way. It is also a lot harsher in that fewer Inspiration points are likely to be gained. <br/><br/>Both ideas are designed to move Inspiration away from being a DM-generated reward system and put the control over when Inspiration is earned squarely in the players' lap. Which is the way I would prefer to have it,  because I honestly hate any subsystem that requires me as the DM to subjectively (but ostensibly objectively) judge whether my players are "doing a good job roleplaying" or not.  Which is what the default BIFTs/inspiration mechanic appears to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438753/#Comment_438753" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-27T16:44:54+00:00" title="September 27, 2014  4:44PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2014 4:45PM by Rafu.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">@Caoimhe</a>, your second way looks to me like it would let a very common gameplay bug crawl in:<br/><br/>When your mechanics reward choosing to fail (or, as in this case, choosing to roll at a disadvantage), the "optimal" strategy of play is to initiate conflicts you don't mind failing at, with the only purpose to fail at them, so that you "charge up" for future conflicts you actually care about. Usually, this results in a lot o play-time being wasted over conflicts nobody cares about at all, as a form of necessary "prep" for the relevant ones; "reverse grinding", I'd call it.<br/><br/>Things like Fate compels (though I much prefer <i>retroactive</i> compels) or Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System refresh work best when they introduce new complications into the plot, rather than just have you fail at one task/conflict, or expend in-game currencies (HPs, fate points to resist the compel, etc.)<br/><br/>I would play with your "honor system". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438755/#Comment_438755" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-27T17:29:09+00:00" title="September 27, 2014  5:29PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's why I think the first system is better, if I'm going to use Inspiration at all.

I think finding a cue phrase "That gives me inspiration, right?" was key to that. A subtler gesture could work as well, like taking it from a bowl or tapping your sheet or turning a card upside down. I'm on board with the DM having veto but that's possible with the bowl as well if they see the bowl and can say "Hey, wait"<br/><br/>Idea: I kind of want to make "inspiration cards" now. Cards that on one side say: "Inspiration<br/>You are inspired! Flip this card over before a roll to do one of these things:<br/>\u2022 Get advantage on a saving throw, attack roll or ability check<br/>\u2022 Negate disadvantage<br/>\u2022 Let a friend flip their card over"<br/>and on the other side say some ideas for what allows them to flip it back.<br/>Then you could do it silently. And the two sides could have different colors so I could see if there were shenanigans. <br/><br/>Otoh I kind of don't mind it anymore when game mechanics show themselves a little, which is why I'm fine with the verbal cue. It makes it more real to me, at the cost of immersion, which I'm fine with.

I've always found that term to be sortof useless.  Even The Alexandrian has basically backpedaled his stance on them from (Paraphrasing) "You're not roleplaying when you use them, so games with them aren't roleplaying games."  to simply "Dissociated mechanics are fine as long as they serve a good purpose." which, at the end of the day is "Dissociated mechanics are fine as long as you like the results." which is pretty much what people have been saying about them all along.  I never understood the hooplah.<br/><br/>I can see Caoimhe's point a little bit, but I think it mostly stems from "Inspiration" being a really poorly chosen name for this mechanic;  It makes it SOUND like a mechanic that means something in the fiction, like your character is somehow, well, "inspired" to do better, but the mechanic doesn't work in any way like you would expect your character being "inspired" to work.  This, I think, is really where the discussion around 'dissociated' mechanics should be focused - it's not the fact that mechanics are dissociated that makes them feel weird to most people, it's that the mechanic seems to map poorly to what people think it is supposed to do.  If you get a Banana Point for good roleplaying, and the only way to cast spells is to spend a Banana Point, people are going to rail because the metagame resource doesn't seem connected to the act the character is actually performing, but as soon as it's not "cast a spell" but "receive a karmic benefit" or something, a lot of people will nod and say "Sure, no problem." and if Banana Points are instead awarded for, I dunno, kindness and mercy, rather than "good roleplaying" you have a feedback loop that encourages a type of gameplay and that jars relatively few people, even though it's still a 'dissociated' metagame resource.  <br/><br/>Hm. That was quite a tangent.  Anyway, Inspiration is a poorly selected name, because the effect granted doesn't map cleanly to the name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438817/#Comment_438817" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T10:27:44+00:00" title="September 29, 2014 10:27AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so we have two disagreements here, because the name?

I've acknowledge that many of my problems with Fate were not widely reported, such as the whole "buying off compels" thing which still seems like a weird rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438821/#Comment_438821" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T13:27:13+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  1:27PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You think the name is perfect?  Can you elaborate?  The process as described doesn't appear to map to any idea of "inspiration" I've ever understood.<br/><br/>Can you say that you felt inspired by donating your last dollar to charity two days ago, and it really helped you improve your time in the race you ran today?  Inspiration is, generally, a fleeting thing that is 'used' in the moment.  When someone stands up, waves a flag, and leads you to charge an enemy position, you are being inspired.   It is momentary. You cannot save it for later, and you certainly cannot transfer it to someone else.  Indeed, you usually can't even create it in yourself. <br/><br/>If I were writing a game mechanic called "inspiration" it would be a line on the character sheet where the character records something that inspires him - Bravery.  Selflessness. A pretty face. Whatever. And when he sees that thing, then he gets a bonus, then and there, for doing something.  But it wouldn't last outside of the scene in which it was generated.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D5 'inspiration' mechanic does not fit with my understanding of the term.  The idea of "stay true to yourself" is a fine one, but does not in any way map to "inspiration" for me.  And, apparently, for some other people here.<br/><br/>Regarding your other 'question', who, exactly, is saying "We should add Fate to D&amp;D"?  Most of what I have read on the topic is people regarding these two games as different approaches that are best used for different types of games, not about comingling them in some way.<br/><br/>I don't want to speak for anyone else here, but I have the sense that BIFTs don't really map very closely to aspects, and that Inspiration is only vaguely analogous to Fate Points, so the whole thing, while an interesting thought exercise, is still comparing apples to, at the least, peaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438823/#Comment_438823" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T14:08:10+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  2:08PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that this thread has done a pretty good job of pointing out both the similarities and the differences between these two things.

Inspiration is something you can have that enables you to do better. So is a "fate point" or a "hero point", but I think the idea of inspiration maps pretty well to 5e inspiration <em>once you have it.</em>  It also maps well to to what you would get for being consistent with a characteristic. The character acts true to their nature and that's what inspires them.<br/>Donating the dollar, wow, that's inspiring, feel good about myself and will do better. Removes doubt.&gt;<br/>Even evil characters getting inspiration for evil things. "Keeping the dollar, yeah, that's me. Always looking out for number one."<br/><br/>But: just as I insist on my wonky experiences with Fate's compels being viewed as real, I have to honor others' take that the name "Inspiration" was weird to them.<br/><br/>As for people adding Fate to 5e: I had seen it somewhere a while ago and it was part of what I wanted to do this post. Another weird thing to doubt.

I do agree that having the GM judge what it's good roleplaying and reward it, isn't at all a good idea for a mechanic since more often than not, the taste of a single person won't be able to please the taste of everyone at the table. Also, as a rule its potentially toxic as it may lead to the wrong (in the sense of un-fun) idea that the GM can/has to control/has the right to limit the extents of roleplaying for all the players.<br/><br/>And tons of other crap.<br/><br/>But I can attest this works (perhaps only) on the case of the GM being sensitive enough to gauge how good is the reaction of all the players to an idea or performance of another player; and then rewarding that player for making everyone's experience better. In my personal case, I can notice when a player starts roleplaying or just goes tactical in a way that makes the whole scene better, but then I check everyone at the table quickly to have a measure of their reaction. If they laugh, participate in the plan/joke/roleplaying or just pay more attention, that's a good sign that the player hasn't only attain Inspiration, but has in fact inspired the whole table into motion. <br/><br/>Now, my players don't like to roleplay getting into trouble themselves in purpose, so even when we used Aspect-like mechanics in other games and I compelled them getting into trouble for aspects like "I always help those in need", all I got from them was a reluctant compromise instead of roleplaying, even with the reward of a fate point for it. Or on other cases, they only used such aspects when they were offered a choice but felt like using them gave them control of which sort of problem they were getting into, but did it in a way that felt more like they were pushing a button. Yet we all love Aspects as a way to bring depth and personality to our characters, and as a GM I feel beter when these don't come into play as mechanical bonuses but as sources of inspiration for twists and roleplaying.<br/><br/>Allow me to clarify that we're talking here of a table comprised half by players that like to roleplay more than rollplay and half the opposite. We tolerate each other fine and have lots of fun, but the kind of scenes both groups of players enjoy the most are when players visibly twist the story through their roleplaying of clever tactical ideas, so that's why as a GM I feel everyone at the table feels better when one player is rewarded for this, instead of for getting themselves (and the group) in trouble.<br/><br/>However I do agree that we're a particular group of players and no two tables are the same, so generalizing this as a rule seems totally inappropiate as I stated on the first pharagraph.

an idea or performance of another player; and then rewarding that player for making everyone's experience better. In my personal case, I can notice when a player starts roleplaying or just goes tactical in a way that makes the whole scene better, but then I check everyone at the table quickly to have a measure of their reaction. If they laugh, participate in the plan/joke/roleplaying or just pay more attention, that's a good sign that the player hasn't only attain Inspiration, but has in fact inspired the whole table into motion.</blockquote>\nThis sounds like the principle bonus dice in <i>Sorcerer</i> are supposed to operate on, according to Ron Edwards himself (the text can be quite opaque, due to its considerable age, even in its Annotated edition).<br/>I personally find this exhausting when I'm the GM (what, <i>one more</i> task I have to attend to, distracting me from the many I'm juggling already?), so much in fact that I house-rule any such mechanics into something akin to PTA fan-mail, making character-players the judges of each other's performance instead of me. But I'm well-aware this "RAW Sorcerer" way works fine for many others; it obviously works for Ron.<br/><br/>Of course, doing it my way requires that everyone at the table is confident with role-playing and with commenting on each other's play already. Were I to play D&amp;D5 with my usual friends (I'm most likely not, due to mine and their general preferences) I'd go with <a href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe%27s">@Caoimhe's</a> "honor-based system" in a heartbeat! But, given that D&amp;D often happens to be people's first game, or "gateway" game into role-playing, or to be enjoyed by children and teenage players, I can see doing it your way has significant merits, <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>: it might be a useful "teaching" tool when the DM is a more experienced player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438903/#Comment_438903" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-02T09:20:19+00:00" title="October  2, 2014  9:20AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll add to that:<br/><br/>I think something like a "GM doles out bonus points" mechanic works well when it's embedded within another procedure which the GM must carry out.

Similarly for, "At the end of the game, grant a player a bonus XP if they hit their Key this session at least once."<br/><br/>"Give the player Inspiration whenever they happen to do something which might be related to one of their BIFTs", though, is additional stress on the GM, since she must now keep track of a ton of information for each player, even at times when she is (or should be) focused on other tasks, like managing spotlight or playing an NPC (or whatever).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438904/#Comment_438904" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-02T09:28:16+00:00" title="October  2, 2014  9:28AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say it isn't exactly a more experienced player's skill, but a specific personality trait. I trained my whole life to get my group empaty at this level, but have only GMd irregularily for ten years maybe. And even then, I'm prone to misread certain reactions, take too long to bring fun-killing situations to an end; I kinda hope the perpetrator notices what's going on and finish it himself, but often that doesn't happen quickly enough if not at all. On other occasions the person I think is being victimized is actually seeing the whole thing on a different way and enjoying it, while I think they are just being polite not to explode right away.<br/><br/>What I mean is that this personality trait is less common than designers think, and that maybe more games should be designed thinking less optimistically about the players, or at least making less assumptions about the personality traits that the players are going to show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438905/#Comment_438905" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-02T09:48:49+00:00" title="October  2, 2014  9:48AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2014 10:08AM by WarriorMonk.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>"Give the player Inspiration whenever they happen to do something which might be related to one of their BIFTs", though, is additional stress on the GM, since she must now keep track of a ton of information for each player, even at times when she is (or should be) focused on other tasks, like managing spotlight or playing an NPC (or whatever).<br/></blockquote>\nAs seen by how <a href="/forums/profile/2097%27s">@2097's</a> group plays it isn't hard for them to do. Well, the player who engages in the inspiration rule asks for the reward, but even if she doesn't I'd bet other players or the GM will remind her of it, am I wrong?  What I mean is that different GMs focus on different things in different ways when they GM. I can focus easier on game moments with higher flow (for our group) and reward the one who made it possible. Other GMs focus on different things. 2097 can possibly detect when a player engages with their BIFTs. In her group it doesn't seem to be that difficult: the player in question would be willingly putting herself in trouble in most of the cases. That's something no GM can miss, though probably most would take that as an excuse to show off how wicked a monster can be or how nasty a trap can be, instead of rewarding that player with spotlight time besides Inspiration BEFORE bad things start to happen.<br/><br/>I wrote "BEFORE" like that because this is a very important difference: whenever a GM teaches their players that "making a mistake" isn't fun in their games, players will deliberately stop roleplaying their character flaws, making invalid half or more of the Inspiration rule as it's written. They will do everything they can to stay out of trouble, making the GM eventually resorting to a dregree of railroading if she didn't started using this from the start of the game. I know more than one GM who plays that way. "Making mistakes" or roleplaying character flaws in their games isn't fun at all, it means that bad things are going to happen and that's why the GM started laughing like a cartoon villain when your half orc gave up to his temper and took a stand against the human NPC that was making snark remarks about his friends at the bar. And most probably that GM won't give you time to roleplay your character the way you want before pulling the 8 city guards in full armor that were drinking beer among the crowd of the bar, that you failed to notice because you didn't ask for a perception roll.<br/><br/>It's totally different if nothing out of proportion happens when a player "makes a mistake" on purpose for the sake of good roleplaying. If a player engages in roleplaying a character flaw knowing that it will bring her trouble, but it doesn't cost her the life of her PC (or worse, the life of a fellow PC) but instead it makes things more interesting, then fully engaging and rewarding the Inspiration mechanic in that way will obviously become a second nature. I'd love to play like that, but me and my players are badly marked with in-fiction paranoia, having played before with GMs in whose games, making mistakes and roleplaying flaws was not fun at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438927/#Comment_438927" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-02T19:10:41+00:00" title="October  2, 2014  7:10PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having the player (or any player) flag and announce moments of Inspiration is, indeed, an easy solution to this problem (if it exists in your group). Frees up the GM to focus on other things.<br/><br/>In a group where "making mistakes" is not a positive behaviour (which sounds like not much fun to me, but there are some valid playstyles where that would very much be the correct way to play), couldn't you simply rephrase your BIFTs so as to make their activation as positive as possible?<br/><br/>Instead of having a BIFT which is about throwing yourself headfirst into danger, write one which is about your character making sure he's always prepared for the upcoming danger, or paranoid about trusting people, or whatever suits the game and the character. Then "playing to your BIFTs" won't necessarily feel like "making a mistake".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438929/#Comment_438929" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-02T21:02:35+00:00" title="October  2, 2014  9:02PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a conversation in the group I'm playing in (that has only had chargen and one full session so far, but has been very interesting!) on more or less that topic, Paul, as I think I alluded to upthread.

In Fate if you are compelled to start a fight with same poachers you get one fate point. Possibly it costs you fate points to deal with the fight.<br/>Here is one example from a 5e game. We were playing from prep (that I had made) and the prep said that two Swarms of Bats was sleeping in a cave. If the characters had entered that cave, they would've fought the bats. They entered a nearby cave, connected directly (through open corridor) to the bats and also via a door to some kobolds' kitchen. One of the players played to his flaw and shouted "Hello", asked for and received inspiration. The bats flew out and they defeated them quickly but took some HP loss (not more than fatigue level, but still, isn't HP worth more than Insp?)<br/>Another example is from a 5e game I played in and posted an AP thread about here. We were playing hard to our characteristics, but we hadn't a clear protocol for the gm to give us insp, it seems like he didn't know the rule. The player to my right had the flaw "When I see a demon I will stop and take notes rather than running away" and he did, he stood very close to a retriever demon to write and it was potentially very dangerous. We saved him though.<br/><br/>Another example in the "bat game", later they were in town and one had the bond "I will do anything to be superior to my hated rival" and pulled himself into many interesting story moments with that NPC, which led to both insp and information for the party.

We were playing from prep (that I had made) and the prep said that two Swarms of Bats was sleeping in a cave. If the characters had entered that cave, they would've fought the bats. They entered a nearby cave, connected directly (through open corridor) to the bats and also via a door to some kobolds' kitchen. One of the players played to his flaw and shouted "Hello", asked for and received inspiration. The bats flew out and they defeated them quickly but took some HP loss (not more than fatigue level, but still, isn't HP worth more than Insp?)<br/></blockquote>\nA-ha! two things: it was <i>just</i> a swarm of bats. Yeah mechanically they do deal damage, but nothing as deadly as, say, 3-4 zombies for a party of 1st lvl characters, which is what the GMs we played would have done. And HP can be recovered without too many consequences anyway, so it looks like in your game being true to the character flaws IS fun, it gives the players spotlight and the consequences for it are interesting instead of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inmediatly lethal</span>. That thing I underlined it's a really important key here: Sure, it's no fun if there's no real danger, as many GMs love to think, say out-loud and defend, I agree with them totally. But that ain't a justification for turning the scene into something as "Hello?" *GM rolls dice for damage* "Ok, you're dead! roll a new character"<br/><br/>Not that it isn't actually a valid way of playing, but at least for me, that's a totally different game and not one I love to play everyday.\n<blockquote><br/>Another example is from a 5e game I played in and posted an AP thread about here. We were playing hard to our characteristics, but we hadn't a clear protocol for the gm to give us insp, it seems like he didn't know the rule. The player to my right had the flaw "When I see a demon I will stop and take notes rather than running away" and he did, he stood very close to a retriever demon to write and it was potentially very dangerous. We saved him though.<br/></blockquote>\nDid the player got the Inspiration in the end? Even if he didn't, any story you character can still tell by itself at the inn, is a good story <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> and it's probably something that you'll try again as a player.\n<blockquote><br/>Another example in the "bat game", later they were in town and one had the bond "I will do anything to be superior to my hated rival" and pulled himself into many interesting story moments with that NPC, which led to both insp and information for the party. (Which was great, but left the other players a little outside of the spotlight. In retrospect, that rival could've been a PC maybe.)<br/><br/>So yeah, I don't go out of my way to punish them, but I try to play "sandbox style" to the best of my ability.<br/>I see the insp as kind of a consolation prize or perhaps a wholly orthogonal reward: you suffer in the game but you got a little ribbon (and small in game benefit) that you were true to your character. Somehow, weirdly, that motivates you to do weird things.</blockquote>\nYou're right, it's an orthogonal reward because in your game, the real reward is getting spotlight while creating a good moment by putting your character at risk. I'd say every GM loves that, but compelling that from the players is by far a totally inferior experience against letting players create those moments. And rewarding them with spotlight, a not impossible challenge, and something as good but as limited as a single point of Inspiration is the right recipe to get those scenes rolling. Providing of course, that you haven't ruined your players with an unbalance of any of those rewards.<br/><br/>So, no wonder you and people who had a similar experience can easily compare it with fate points, while others like me prefer to award Inspiration when players do different things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438959/#Comment_438959" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T10:44:01+00:00" title="October  3, 2014 10:44AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a completely different angle:<br/><br/>This may or may not be useful, but I found <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19131/clarity-a-neat-little-rule" rel="nofollow">a really neat rule in a game called "Dreamwake"</a> a while back. If you wanted to put *more* focus on Inspiration, and use it as a moment to build story and develop character, you could trying using something like this. The player gets Inspiration... the other players get to learn more about the character's inner life.<br/><br/>Not applicable to many D&amp;D games, but could be really fun in some. Would add a whole introspective angle to the game, and then right back into the action!<br/><br/>I would imagine it kind of like a voiceover, as in some comics or film noir ("And then I realized that the stranger leaving the bar that night stirred up some unwelcome memories...").<br/><br/>One other upside is it makes it really clear when Inspiration is gained or not, and we always know *why* (because, even if there is no good reason for it, the players and/or GM can ask leading questions, and we'll *come up* with something interesting about the character in the process, even if initially the call may have been a little too vague - let's say I call for Inspiration because there's a glint of something under the water: it doesn't REALLY sound like this fits my BIFTs, so a player would probably ask, "What does this remind you of? A moment from your childhood? A lost love?", and then we'll end all learning something new and cool about the character).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438966/#Comment_438966" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T13:31:42+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  1:31PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great posts; to clarify about the two swarms of bats (a medium encounter for a group of 1 level characters) was chosen because that was reasonable <em>according to the prep</em>, not according to what would've been a good or bad play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439912/#Comment_439912" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T18:22:57+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  6:22PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Mearls said in the AMA today that D&amp;D 5e was inspired by Dungeon World (the empire eating the indie), Fate and Gumshoe.

But I've never seriously considered going back to it after 5e.<br/><br/><br/>Second, what's the similarity between 5e and Fate? I would've gone much harder in on this similarity in hindsight, re-reading my old posts I was hedging &amp; falling back instead of standing my ground.<br/><br/>Obv they both have a consistently adjudicated mechanical reward for using fictional positioning in the SIS to get an advantage. This, at the point of 5e:s release, was an unusual design feature and it's brilliantly realized in 5e. <b>This, more than anything, was Fat's legendary "killer app" and 5e does it better.</b><br/>Fate "I get on top of the \u2610Toppled Heavy Bookcase (andinvoke the tag I got earlier), so I can reroll my roll".<br/>5e "I get on top of the toppled heavy bookcase to get advantage so I can get the highest of two rolls."<br/><br/><br/><br/><em>And</em> they both have a meta game resource for when your freeform descriptions ("Aspects"/"Traits") get you into trouble (or however you want to phrase it).<br/><br/>The two key features of Fate, and they're right there in 5e's core (well, adv/disadv is). The third big feature of Fate is roll+adds vs TN, which, well, 5e also has.<br/><br/>Changes:<br/>\u2022 "Buying off compels" is free in 5e<br/>\u2022 You spend the insp before you roll, no "retcon". More of a FitE "I'm really put effort into this roll", "bet"-like feeling. "I bet that this'll be a roll that I would've lost if I hadn't advantage but will succeed if I have advantage." Or, desperation, when you really need that success. It tells the whole table "I care about this roll", which is great handtalk.<br/>\u2022 The econ doesn't go out of wack. I've had this happen a lot in Fate<br/>\u2022 To advantageously fictionally position yourself in 5e doesn't cost meta resources. I mean, you're doing something cool (actualizing the SIS) and you have to <i>pay</i> for it in Fate? 5e making it always free makes so much more sense.<br/><br/>5e fixes issues I hadn't even realized were fixable in Fate, I had noticed how the gears creaked and went rusty sometimes, but I thought it was "worth it".<br/><br/>Third, the guy who was always buying off his compels. I figured it out later. He wanted to portray a character who struggled with <i>overcoming</i> addiction, and all the compels I gave him were about <i>giving in</i> to addiction. It was his first time playing the game and he hadn't read the book, I just explained char gen and we were off to the races. If he had been familiar with compels he might've worded it differently. If I had been more insightful, I could've given him compels related to his other aspects, or compels where he <i>was</i> resisting his addiction but it caused him some sort of trouble. For example, an old junkie friend contacts him. Or I dunno. I think he also wanted the experience of "bleeding out" Fate Points martyrdorm.<br/>Anyway, 90% of the thread became how I was playing it wrong because of this one guy, so... <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/>Just wanted to clear that up.<br/><br/>Fate for me becomes one of those games where everywhere I look, I see people "playing it wrong"; like I'm thinking "Oh... you interpreted that as 'Create An Advantage?' To me it looked like pretty clear cut 'Overcome'." or vice versa. DW is another one of those games actually. I often go "That's... not how that's supposed to work". For example, I saw a game of DW the other day where the GM said "The [some sorta monster, I don't remember] makes a sweeping attack across the room, you all must make Defy Danger rolls. And if you don't want to use Dex for it, you better give me a very good reason." That was a mistake, I think. Instead, it's supposed to be: "The [monster] makes a sweeping attack across the room, what do you do?" Or at least I think so, for DW. In D&amp;D though, that would've been correct, to ask for dex saves. [BTW to that GM -- I make these kinds of mistakes all the time regardless of game, don't worry about it.]<br/><br/>Maybe one day a game can be invented that is both consistently applicable cross groups, <i>and</i> good. It hasn't happened yet.<br/><br/>To me, that's a drawback of a system. Another problem we had with Fate was getting players to actually play with the aspects. To actually flip that desk or what have you instead of just focusing on their skills w/o aspects. Again, Fate's design decision to actually <em>tax</em> you a metagame resource to just successfully leverage fictional positioning is pretty questionable there <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>Four: How to deal with insp in practice. We ended up using tokens that the DM can hand out or the players grab. Even if you already have Inspiration, you can get it again. But when you spend it, you use all of it. This makes it so that there's effectivly a cap of one. One <i>usage</i>, and then you'll be at zero again.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463210/#Comment_463210" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T23:05:59+00:00" title="May  9, 2017 11:05PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In Fate if you are compelled to start a fight with same poachers you get one fate point. Possibly it costs you fate points to deal with the fight.</p></div></blockquote>\nI believe this is a misapplication of the rules. It is not your fault, as the Fate rules are notoriously difficult to apprehend. This is a fault with the rules themselves, as they are so abstract and loose. In the scenario where you are compelled to start a fight with poachers, it would be best for the compel to skip the conflict rules altogether. The compel here is the resolution. The character fights the poachers...and then what? In PBtA parlance, the GM makes a move: the character is captured, he suffers a consequence, the poachers radio for backup, or so forth.<br/><br/>I would recommend this approach for 5e inspiration likewise:\n<blockquote>Another example is from a 5e game I played in and posted an AP thread about here. We were playing hard to our characteristics, but we hadn't a clear protocol for the gm to give us insp, it seems like he didn't know the rule. The player to my right had the flaw "When I see a demon I will stop and take notes rather than running away" and he did, he stood very close to a retriever demon to write and it was potentially very dangerous. We saved him though.</blockquote>\nThis seems a mismatch between player and DM expectations, and I'm guessing a mismatch between playstyles. I think inspiration in 5e is a very weak mechanic stitched to an RPG Frankenstein that's trying (and failing forward) as a storygame. Metagame currency works best in games where the system is light enough that the currency isn't lost in a jumble of spell slots, hit points, and variable recharge powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463232/#Comment_463232" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T14:44:12+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  2:44PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True -though it took me a while to realize this. Perhaps it's part the fault of the people who have been played D&amp;D and forcefully turning a miniature game into a poor story game?. I mean, if you just play D&amp;D with XP for gold or for killing monsters, clean a dungeon or go hexcrawling between dungeons and stay away from things like inspiration, flaws, bonds, etc and even alignment, it's a solid game about creative tactical approaches and resource management. But the moment you start to add a story to the setting, the characters, give them different motivations and objectives, you get a mess as there's no real mechanics to add, drive and manage a story game out of D&amp;D. Everything about the story in D&amp;D is either railroading modules or tons of houserules and advice about how to stitch that monster together.<br/><br/>Some people can make amazingly good Frankensteins though, but that's another deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463234/#Comment_463234" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T15:57:25+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  3:57PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But the moment you start to add a story to the setting, the characters, give them different motivations and objectives, you get a mess as there's no real mechanics to add, drive and manage a story game out of D&amp;D. </blockquote>\nIn general, I do not believe mechanics are necessary for story or roleplaying, which I realize is somewhat perpendicular to the prevailing thought here.

I believe that depending of many factors such as how our minds process things, the mental flux diagrams we use to deal with them, the priorities we give to one sort of experience over another and how all this interacts with our specific group of players, among other things, are what makes us perceive one or another form of mechanization as over-mechanization. <br/><br/>Things that other people need to mechanize may end up looking way too complicated for us, as our minds are focused and more efficient at processing the data that other people need mechanics, tables and procedures for. If I had realized this before triggering and spouting so much gibberish against Sandra the past months, things probably wouldn't go so far.<br/><br/>So, if you've got a facilitator and a group that excel at certain type of gameplay, you can give them any system, (even something counterintuitive for them!) and they will adapt to make it perform the gameplay they want. That's how there's been so much people playing D&amp;D like it's a story game with complete and memorable success!<br/><br/>You're right here, in that anything that feels like an over-mechanization to you will most probably feel the same for your group (as you're accustomed to their way of handling things) and thus break immersion for all of you. However, some other people with a different group will probably feel that mechanization useful and necessary.<br/><br/>For example, I think that the conversation part in a RPG is better left uninterrupted for as long as you can. Things like checking stat blocks, rules and heavy bookkeeping in middle game, as well as using complex random tables are an over-mechanization that breaks immersion at my table. On top of that I have some problematic memory issues that prevent me from committing too much of rules and prep to memory, and while I do rely on players for some of the rules searching and bookkeeping, it isn't enough to properly deal with all the work. However I can totally wing things right, Impro and use player's ideas with full coherence. <br/><br/>The only few things I need to mechanize are a procedure to keep world and character creation short and efficient, something to get players players motivated to go after a goal they are actually interested in. Also -definitely- a few tables to improvise monster stats based on the players stats to keep the encounters balanced. Maybe a short procedure for hexcrawl, a simplified version of my DM screen and use my <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">trusty ol cards</a> as an oracle when needed. Then I can make most of my prep about finding pics and music to help my descriptions. That's about it.<br/><br/>Interesting idea with th HP there, though maybe some talking with the players will do. I mean, whenever the monsters reach half of their HP on our table, I gauge the situation and have the monsters try to flee if they realize they are at disadvantage. If they are irrational, fanatic or cornered they may fight to the death. Surrendering is also a good option if it makes any sense to appeal for mercy. So it makes sense to me that I could ask the players to follow a similar rule: when any of them reach half of their HP and are out of resources to heal they could signal the rest and decide as a group if they flee or not. No need to unbalance the system or create something that could break immersion. But that's how it looks from here, it could probably not make any sense at your table <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463266/#Comment_463266" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-11T14:52:45+00:00" title="May 11, 2017  2:52PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2017 2:53PM by ValyrianSteelKatana.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>You're right here, in that anything that feels like an over-mechanization to you will most probably feel the same for your group (as you're accustomed to their way of handling things) and thus break immersion for all of you.

Our first GM was an actor and had a knack for bringing the characters alive. Now whatever makes me look down to read notes for too long, bookkeeping or rules searching feels like a total break of immersion to me. I want to talk with the players, keep things going on at the same pace they would go in the real world. It's really stressful whenever I can't. And you'll never be nobody's fool, players want to believe and you're making it possible!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>In my most recent campaign, there were several times in which the 5e system frustrated me because of the lack of sufficient rules for handling certain mechanics, particularly during social encounters.

I use partially an internalized version of some things here and social skill rolls only to resume things when discussions go for too long and the game seems about to stall.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>Also, I believe a lot of how a mechanic makes sense or not comes from how you interpret the results. It was a huge game-changer for me when I read some PbtA games and stopped describing player's low rolls as boring "You miss", and instead describe it like "This was a sure shot, but then the orc turns around as if he sensed your killing intent, moving his shoulder just enough to turn your attack into a glancing blow over his crude pauldron". Before that I had to wait until I rolled high to describe the NPCs and monsters like a real menace, relying too much on my good luck to create threatening battle scenes.<br/><br/>Social rolls can also be thought and interpreted in a more complex way. Instead of "you failed your intimidation roll so miserably that even though you're a 6' tall brute orc you come out as a  furious fluffy puppy" it could be turned into "You tower menacingly over the puny human. You can smell his fear, but he doesn't yield and now you're either suspecting he's got backup, maybe some magic available or just skill. He might be bluffing or underestimating you, the thing is that there's so many things that could be going on that it makes you doubt intimidating him further could be a good idea. At least until you find out some more things about this guy and this place"<br/><br/>It's like using the dice roll more like an oracle to guide the development of the scene than as a way to adjudicate developments that make no sense or are just boring. Does it make sense for the innkeeper to suddenly trust the PCs so much that he decides to not charge a dime for their stay? What does he get in exchange? If pcs or npc's arguments make no sense on our table, no roll is called. If it makes perfect sense and everyone gets what they want or realize it's better to give up, no roll is needed. If there's a slight chance the situation may develop an interesting twist, or if the person being convinced is in doubt, that's when the roll is called. <br/><br/>So whenever a player straight calls for a social roll, I ask them: "how do you do it, what do you say to the person?" and if their arguments are solid, I just narrate the consequences. If the stance of the person being intimidated or persuaded changes but he tries to hide it, I call for an Insight roll. He may try to do something of signal another person, that's a perception roll. If the pc is trying to deceive someone, I ask the player for confirmation "Are you trying to deceive him?" and then we either proceed to the roll or go back. Then the NPC reacts to the new information accordingly to his personality, principles, situation etc.<br/><br/>You can make even less rolls if you compare the PC and NPC stats instead of calling for rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19763/d-d-5e-inspiration-compared-to-fate-core" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19763/d-d-5e-inspiration-compared-to-fate-core" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19763/d-d-5e-inspiration-compared-to-fate-core/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19763%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19763%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
