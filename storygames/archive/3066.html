Let me add my personal thoughts:<br/><br/>I'm super excited about this event. Duh. Here's why. My first daughter, Jadyn, was born with a minor difference to her left hand; basically, she's missing her fingers. My wife and I did a lot of research about treatment options, physical therapy, etc. In the course of our research, we discovered that one of the leading doctors in the country for this type of issue practices out of the Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia. We also learned a lot more about the Shriners Hospitals--like that part about treating every kid that walks through the door for free. I confess, the only thing I previously "knew" about the Shriners was their funny hats and little cars. (See the cover of the Dead Kennedys Frankenchrist album. Did you know they are not a religious organization? They were founded by an actor, who co-opted the Middle Eastern motif to drum of excitement for his efforts.<br/><br/>As luck would have it, my wife hails from York, PA--just a few hours west of Philly. As part of our annual pilgrimage up north for the holidays, we made an appointment for Jadyn. Within minutes of walking through the doors, I found myself misty-eyed. Sitting in the lobby are some kids with physical issues the worst of your imagination cannot conjure. Amazingly, they are all happy, laughing, playing with the innumerable toys placed around for all the kids. Not surprisingly, this made me appreciate how lucky Jadyn is, even with her own issue.<br/><br/>Now, I make a comfortable living as an attorney. I've got health insurance. Candidly, we took Jadyn to the Shriners Hospital only for their expertise. I could not help but be moved by my experience--to think of all the great work these people are doing for underprivileged children. Since that time, I've done what I can to assist them in their effort. I've donated my own money, and I'm hopeful that this effort will raise additional money as well. Even if you can't participate in our VIP Game (and unfortunately space is limited due to the restrictions of the site), I encourage you to donate on your own. But I'm also hopeful that, at a minimum, this event will bring some attention to their worthwhile cause.<br/><br/>And, oh yeah, they have a really cool "lounge" type area for the kids. I can't wait until Jadyn is a little older and I can run some games for the kids while they wait. That will be a great day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70178/#Comment_70178" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:31:56+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:31AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds fantastic!

Attendees, including spectators, will get free food and drink, free swag, and get to watch one of the truly great d20 GMs in Lee and one of the guys who frickin' wrote d20 Future. The event is premised on the idea that gamers are, by and large, pretty compassionate and magnanimous. I expect people will be willing to pay principally because every dollar they pay will go to the charity. The perks will be just that--extra bennies.\n<blockquote>How much money (after the food, prizes, and so on) do events like these raise for charity?</blockquote>\nWell, it's not like I've run something like this before.

And spectators could influence die rolls either way, to achieve whatever they thought would be fun, challenging, and cool, by likewise bidding actual money. So you get this auction-like social engineering where people spend lots of money to get what they want, and the charity benefits. All in good fun.</blockquote>\nThanks. That is cool.

Definitely some great ideas there. In particular, I'm planning on donating some of my own cash of course.
