The author of the game defines and describes the entire structure of the game for the players, and the players go along with the plot and characterizations provided by the author. (Not much of a game, but it's an extreme example... I don't know of any real game that would play like that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the game is like playing "let's pretend". The author of the game says, "The only rule is that there are no rules. Okay, GO!" and the players take over from there. (Again, it's an extreme example, and not much of a game.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on some level, all role-playing games fit in between these two extremes. There is an author, who describes the game, and the players, who either accept the rules as written or modify the rules to suit their own tastes. It's a way of formally defining "rules-light" games versus "rules-heavy" games, and re-casting those descriptions as "author-controlled" game rules versus "player-controlled" game rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the players always have the final say in the matter -- they get to decide wether or not to follow the author's rules. But if the author writes player-controlled rules into the system, then it's a different kind of game system than a "house rules" game that the players came up with by themselves, because the player-controlled game system is (presumably) designed to handle the different kinds of rules that the players could come up with (and house rules are notorious for their ability to break author-controlled game systems).<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Here's a fun mental puzzle for the extreme author-controlled end of the spectrum -- when you're reading a book, is everything you're getting from of the story put there by the author? For example, if I tell you, "I went for a run early this morning on a path through a cold, deserted park," you've developed a mental image of running through a park on a February morning, even though you don't know any of the details of my experience. I didn't put that image there, or any of the details you may have added to the scene -- you did that all by yourself. So reading a book is a collaborative effort between you and the author, even though the author doesn't want you to help write the story. In other words, there is no such thing as total authorial control. Makes you want to sympathize with God... heh heh heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S. On the other end of the spectrum, can you truly have a game with no rules? It's a paradox... there's no such thing as total player control either!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast" title="Radaghast"><img alt="Radaghast" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/252/nT6IX77SIXBAG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast">Radaghast</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57911/#Comment_57911" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T14:35:37+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  2:35PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda fail to see why do you think that <b>railroading</b> (your first example) versus <b>IF</b> (your second example) distinction is the same as rules-light and rules-heavy rpg classification.

On the other end of the spectrum, can you truly have a game with no rules? It's a paradox... there's no such thing as total player control either!</blockquote>I think you can make up something like that. It's just not actually a game.<br/><br/>I don't have a fully-formed 100%-useful definition of "game" to offer here, but there are pieces. I think the most important bit is that all games involve a mixture of constraints and choice.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, without choice, there is no game, because there is no meaningful play. You're probably heard people say this like a hundred times, so I won't elaborate.<br/><br/>But, without constraints, there is no game either. Boundaries create the "magic circle" of the game -- the mental space of the game. There's a book called <i>Rules of Play</i> (Salen and Zimmerman, 2004), which covers a broad variety of games and aspects of game design, wherein the authors emphasize this as a fundamental distinction between a "game" and just "play" (e.g. playing with Legos or dolls): a game makes it pretty explicit when you're playing and when you're not, and what you can do when you are playing. You can fidget with the pieces of a chess set while you're sitting around in your living room, for example, but, once you've entered the "magic circle" of a chess game, you've bought into this framework where you only interact with the board in a very specific way. This is all tied into the social contract of a game, of course, and the "magic circle" is very important in an RPG because you need it to build up the "shared fiction" / "shared imagined space" / whatever-you-want-to-call-it of the game, but distinct from those. (Of the relatively few games I'm familiar with, I think <i>Polaris</i> is the one that makes this "magic circle" the most explicit, through the use of ritual to start and stop play.)<br/><br/>Additionally, you need constraints to make choices meaningful. If I can choose to do anything at any time, my choices don't really "stick," so to speak. The game-as-a-set-of-decisions doesn't really exist. And the narrative of the game, if it's still there, is on a very shakey footing, since you can basically zap the entire thing into nonexistence at any time.<br/><br/>So, err, I guess the point of that ramble is that you need both those things, both options and boundaries. Which is why you observe the "spectrum" to be snipped at both ends in your first post.<br/><br/><br/>I'm not quite sure that "player-controlled" vs. "author-controlled" are good names for this stuff, though. Especially if we're lumping in the GM as a player.<br/><br/>Imagine a D&amp;D game. Let's say this particular D&amp;D game is very railroady. If you're playing a character in the game, does it matter whether the railroadiness comes form the GM or the author of a published module? It's important in the sense that you have to treat the situation differently: you can't teach a published module new tricks, but you also can't just give up on your GM altogether without hurting his feelings. In terms of your overall play experience, though, I think it's pretty similar, which is why I wouldn't really separate those very strongly.<br/><br/>In that example, the GM is experiencing the game differently depending on whether it's him or the module that's doing the railroading, but the players get something very similar either way. The reason they do stand out as separate is that a GM is usually a lot more flexible than a rulebook as a central authority. A GM who constantly exerts his authority to control every facet of the game isn't that different from a book steadfastly telling you what to do -- it's just that most GMs aren't doing this in practice. So, I'd say that they probably wouldn't fall on the same place in the spectrum, but to say that a hyper-railroady game is no different from freeform or <i>Universalis</i> because the former involves a GM rather than the author exerting authority rather weakens the utility of this model you've introduced. (Then what we've really got is a discussion of the operational rules of play and rule-breaking behavior -- which can be very fruitful, but I don't think is quite where you were going with this.)<br/><br/><br/>So that's why I think it's better to, perhaps, express the idea in terms of the growing and shriking of some kind of possibility space, rather than in terms of who's got control, because the important thing about who's got control is how that then affects that possibility space for everyone else.<br/><br/>Of course, if I'm completely misreading your initial idea, Rick, please let me know.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58023/#Comment_58023" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-24T21:34:20+00:00" title="February 24, 2007  9:34PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2007 9:34PM by misuba.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rick: all I mean is that lots of rules does not necessarily equal a game with a high level of author control.
