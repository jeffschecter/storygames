I know enough about the World of Near to game there (i.e., the kind of stuff that goes on), but I'm free to invent details as necessary.  <i>Dogs</i> does this one better by including some tight situation-building rules that invoke the culture at every turn--so "adventuring" in <i>Dogs</i> is largely about saying what should, and what should not, be permitted in Faithful culture.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Actually, thinking of D&amp;D;, I think the original <i>Oriental Adventures</i> didn't do that bad a job.  Tucked in the back were 3-4 pages on feudal China and Japan, where pretty much everything is useful.  It's interesting to contrast this with the <i>Kara-Tur</i> setting published a few years later--it's depressing to think that a tree gave its life for something so utterly inert.)<br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\nIn addition to discussing this, let's make a list of cultural things you feel are "necessary" to gaming:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Names.  Bad Fantasy Name Syndrome is a setting-killer for me.  Either use names from real cultures, or spend a little bit of research figuring out how linguistics works.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Costumes.  Am I the only person who remembers <i>Time of the Dragon</i>?  It was this Dragonlance boxed set, and it had these colored cardstock pictures of people in their different regalia.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Foods.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Ways of fighting.  One of the things I like about <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> is that each culture wages war very differently.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60412/#Comment_60412" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T16:16:22+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  4:16PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The things that make tSoY and Dogs work for me in this regard is that there is a good balance of Big Stuff and Little Stuff. <br><br>With Big Stuff, I'm meaning the large, overall setting stuff, the thing that tell us, in veeery broad strokes, what the setting is about. Like, in Dogs, that's stuff like "There are sorta-indians called Mountain Folk", "The people in the East are like X" and so on. Big Stuff. ^_^<br><br>Little stuff, on the other hand, is the tiny details that make a setting feel real and that help us imagine what things look and feel like. Like how the People in Dogs don't drink alcohol, instead prefering root beer. Or the many examples of a Dogs coat, the Rituals of the Faith, and so on.<br><br>Big Stuff is important because it shows us the world and often what the setting is "about". Little Stuff is important because it allows the players to "zoom in" and imagine our characters in this place. And as always, balance is important. Too much Big Stuff and nobody really has an idea what life in the setting is like, too much Little Stuff and the whole seems boring, overly detailled and nobody really knows what the setting in general is like.<br><br>Hmmm, I think there's probably "Medium Stuff" too, which would be something like "In the city of X, the Guild of Y has it's seat." or maybe even "NPC Z is the head of Guild Y". Without having thought too hard about it, while Medium Stuff probably has a place too, I feel that it might be less important, easier to make up. At least I prefer settings that give me Big and Little Stuff while I make up large portions of the Medium Stuff.<br><br>M                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60416/#Comment_60416" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T17:55:15+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  5:55PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I like the approach of defining most of the Little Stuff (as Minx calls it) with one or two broad cultural comparisons, then specifying a handful of unique exceptions. "It's like heroic age Greece, but the more adventurous folks collect magical singing crystals which provide bonuses when worked into jewelry, and slavery is replaced with the use of clever trained animal hybrids that do all the labor." Or: "it's like the renaissance in space, but with a technology dependent on nanotech 'demons'."</p>\n<p>For the Big Stuff, I prefer several broad procedural statements that create setting details. If you define a culture as bronze-age fantasy with three kinds of magic (Fire, Spirit, Necromancy) and say that Necromancy is common and used for technology, Spirit is rarer and associated with nobility, and Fire is considered criminal, that tells you some things about the society. You begin to wonder if an outlaw with Spirit Magic can pose as a noble, or why Fire Magic is illegal (burning corpses?) If you add another rule about the society being very traditional and bureaucratic, with creativity being rare and underappreciated, you could apply it to make the government efficient at slow, plodding tasks but incompetent at original thinking, which might fit well with the necromancy angle... which leads to thinking about Fire Rebels who value creativity above all things, maybe even a symbolic use of fire to mean creativity. You can describe vast societies with a small number of rules this way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60417/#Comment_60417" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T18:24:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  6:24PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I don't need a lot.
