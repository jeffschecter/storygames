It came down to the fact that I simply love games with human opponents (nations fighting nations, people fighting cultists, and most "monsters" being people, who can be reasoned with at times, killed at others; armies of opposing generals fighting, one nation against another, etc). A campaign world I've kinda dragged from 2e to 3e I couldn't see translating into 4e, simply for the fact that "humanoid" encounters (elves, humans, dwarves, etc) only go up to about Level 2. After that, I can change "Orc Raider" or Gnoll Huntmaster" into "Barbarian Raider" or "Human Shadownhunt Cultist", but after that it's mostly all Flameskulls and Grells and Manticores.<br/><br/>I was thinking that I'd be in the market to see Humanoid "monsters" from level 5-25. Badass humanoid opponents to throw against increasingly powerful PCs, perhaps with unusual abilities (or completely normal abilities at high power: But decidedly NOT me having to make like 25th level Evil Rangers and Evil Clerics with all their stats to throw against the PCs each time; I grew tired of that level of complication quickly in 3e).<br/><br/>So what Jeph mentioned was simply forgetting what the monster IS, look at their stats, and simply change a few damage types and descriptions to again rewrite the "monster" as a person, perhaps rewriting size higher than "Medium" back down to Medium.  Jeph mentioned that he changed a damage type, and effectively rewrote the Gelatinous Cube as a grappling Luchador wrestler.<br/><br/>I went back home and popped open the MM, and basically stabbed my finger into the book randomly.<br/><br/>* Displacer Beast: Now a cultist of a dread Shadow Lord. It blends into half reality-half shadow plane. Its "Bite" is now a "Cold Touch", it's "Tentacle" a "Shadowy Limb" which extends from its cloak.<br/><br/>* Rockfire Dreadnaught: Now a Master Swordsman. Even getting close to him means he's gonna hit you (Waves of Flame fire aura == whirling iado blade). Fist of Flame = It's swords slash so fast that they have a reach of two (he launches forward into an attack stance, then returning to a defensive stance immediately). Brimstone Rock == Expertly thrown kunai blade. Still resistant to fire, as he can nimble dodge out of the way before fire hits him.<br/><br/>*Sorrowsworn Reaper : Now <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu_ZEROeSpk" rel="nofollow">Kenshiro</a>. Sorrow's Scythe is simply a badass martial arts attack. Reaping Blow is Kenshiro pointing at someone before he kicks their ass, telling them how he's gonna kick their ass. Bleak Visage = Still fear, because they've seen what his martial arts can do. <br/><br/>* Needlefang Drake Swarm: ...hmmm... ... ...hmmmmmmm... OK, it doesn't work with ALL monsters.  (^.^)<br/><br/>Anyway, that trick helped me develop a bunch of humanoid-ish opponents at least for characters level 1-10 (my personal "sweet spot"), the ones where I didn't just take "gnoll" and replace it with "human", etc. It's a good trick, and because of it I've thought of a nifty homebrew setting for a future game of 4e. Just wanted to throw Jeph's idea out there in case it gets others thinking as well.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156580/#Comment_156580" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T21:51:17+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  9:51PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can vouch for this technique.

You see their powers as something amazing and interesting again, instead of commonplace among NPCs.  For example, a lot of cleric powers are based off of saintly (or godly) miracles, so you could run a whole campaign based on the idea that the cleric in the party is a messiah or saint, and the other priests of the setting have no supernatural powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156849/#Comment_156849" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T07:41:40+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  7:41AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>They're level 5 now, and they have to deal with a level 11 Elite and its troops tonight.</blockquote>\nDang, we just threw down with an evil dude <i>two </i>levels above us and he nearly kilt us with his four invisible robots.
