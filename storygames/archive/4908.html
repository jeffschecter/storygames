Of course it's pretty easy to point these out, right?  Some of them are deeply ingrained, at least in my way of thinking.  So this is the thread where we suggest effective, positive alternatives to the way it is always done.  <br/><br/>The one that prompted this thread was Paul's "player collaboration makes a game better".

I mean, I can't figure out how one game does collaboration that another doesn't. So, to me it's saying that some game has <i>less</i> collaboration, somehow, and that therefore it's more fun. <br/><br/>For example, we're playing an "old" game -- say, old D&amp;D. But, when I the player say what my character does, as per the rules, I'm collaborating, right? And, when the GM explains the room, same. Right? So, when this doesn't happen, I'm lost to see how that could possibly be "better," which I read as "more fun."<br/><br/>Now, the other way to see it is that "collaboration" means "players doing stuff outside their character." And, I wonder if that's what the sacred-cow-killer means. I think it is. <br/><br/>If so, I s'pose I can point to bunches of games that limit player input of this kind that are schloads of fun for many people. Let's say, uh, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, which I played and enjoyed a whole lot in my younger days. Or, more currently, something like, I dunno, Arrowflight or one of my indie fav's, a/state!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110025/#Comment_110025" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T10:30:30+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 10:30AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With words like "collaboration" and "better," this is all touchy-feely...but then I guess so is most of our little world of RPG, so I'll move on.<br/><br/>Perhaps Beast Hunters is an indie example?  The system feels more like a series of mandates and one-ups-manships than collaborations, trying to tap into that Gamist action.  And it makes for a fun game, the way that wargames are fun because two people are engaging one another, and at best all they collaborate on are things like what system to use and how "big" the army will be -- and that's more setting ground rules than anything else.<br/><br/>Unless you take "collaborating" so far that it's collaborating to say "I accept that you are using the rules right now, so do what you're going to do."  You know, an insane extreme.<br/><br/>Or maybe "collaboration" in this case means "cooperative campaign creation?"  In that case, there are loads of people who love nothing more than playing a stock Forgotten Realms game run by a GM who has set up the adventures on his own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110031/#Comment_110031" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T10:35:44+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 10:35AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2007 10:36AM by PaulB.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since it was my cow, here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>"Collaboration" as a word is sufficiently broad that it's sort of meaningless. I think the very notion of "collaboration" is itself freighted with all kinds of assumptions in the indie scene: it means players flagging things so the GM knows to play to those flags, or adding in setting bits so everyone has a sense of investment, or spend resources to buy bad guys for your own character to deal with.<br/><br/>I think there are some things that are hard to collaborate around:<br/><br/>* Discovery, the big storygame bugaboo and a repeated deal-breaker among my old-skool play group here<br/><br/>* Strongly tactical play, wherein playing well requires withholding information<br/><br/>* Surprise plot twists/big reveals. A subset of discovery.<br/><br/>* Passive/reactive play styles that are, nevertheless, rewarding for that player.<br/><br/>* System-invisible play: Your character is comprised of things you care about and things you're good at, and the GM is entrusted to handle everything else. (NB this is my most absolutely personally despised model of play and I fucking hate it, but it's certainly out there and a lot of players luuuuuve it).<br/><br/>* Quite possibly, that weird and slipppery fish called "Immersion" may actually be better served in a non-collaborative, high-trust environment.<br/><br/>(Huh...just as I wrote that I had a weird thought pop into my head. Is <i>collaboration </i>the enemy of <i>trust</i>?

I think it centers on the distribution of authority that goes back to the roots of roleplaying games.  And there's something very obviously excellent about that, because a lot of people - most gamers - play games that limit collaboration in specific ways that seem pretty consistent from rule-set to rule-set.  But I seriously doubt any of the designers are really taking a hard look at the assumptions that make it work.    You've got a GM, you've got players, GMs do this, players do this, this bit they do all together.  So I'm challenging us to think about it more, that's all, because even if you're a hippie mutant like Ryan that set-up is like mother's milk, most likely.  <br/><br/>How could you harness that and turn it up to 11 in the service of your design goals rather than just accept it as the status quo?  <br/><br/>*all roleplaying games, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110049/#Comment_110049" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T11:13:14+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 11:13AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random thoughts because, unfortunately, I really must get some work done at some point:<br/><br/>Going back to my list of bullets, you'd be building a game that strives for immersion, discovery, surprises and smart, tactical player-versus-GM play.<br/><br/>Anything scripted, like Matthijs' "We All Had Names", is a zero-collaboration roleplaying exercise. I hesitate to call it a "game" in any meaningful sense. It only works because the participant is thrust into a situation not of his design, and agrees to work his way through it.<br/><br/>I think you'd have to stake out in the beginning an unambiguous "this is what this game is about." The player has to accept that at face value and still go into it with the belief that it'll still be a good ride. Maybe that comes from the GM. Maybe the GM is given a list he has to fill out, which then restricts where his game will go from that point forward. Maybe there are predone setups that aren't quite scripts. It's like setting up a game board.<br/><br/>Wherever you explicitly tell the player, "You have no say in this element" -- setting, situation, NPC, relationship, maybe even elements of the characters themselves! -- I think the player must take that as the stated challenge of the game. A chess player only has 16 predetermined pieces, for example, and has to work those pieces toward a particular goal. At no point does the player say, "Hey...wouldn't it be cool if you let me set up an Alekhine Defense? And then you could take my Queen, because that'd cause me a lot of strife!" It only works because you have two players with limited choices following unambiguous rules. It's the inherent ambiguity of the RPG narrative that makes it hard to play this way.<br/><br/>You could build a game around manipulating the players' trust in the GM. I think that could be fantastically disastrous, actually, without setting that assumption up-front. This is sort of in the realm of the GM being an unreliable witness, in lit-speak.<br/><br/>Gotta get back to work but I'm following this thread avidly.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110050/#Comment_110050" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T11:13:40+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 11:13AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, is collaboration something inherent to the idea of "a group of folks gathering together to have fun?"  And those games are tapping into that naturally-occurring collaboration without hitting it over the head by saying "you guys need to collaborate together on this one element now?"<br/><br/>Man, Jason, you know how to pick a doozy.  I like this topic, because it feels so natural that it's hard for me to say "oh, yeah, that's totally a breakable assumption."  Yet, at the same time, I don't want to take anything like that for granted in design.<br/><br/>There's a game I'm toying with right now where one of my early thoughts was "Oh, I know how to do adventure creation!" where each player brought to the table some element of the adventure that will be encountered -- a foe, a challenge, a quest of some time, etc.  Then last night as I was penning stuff down, I decided that that was too much for this game.  It felt like it'd take away some of my fun as a GM, and some of the fun in playing if you like being surprised by things.  Anyway, I mention this because I'm wondering if this is me putting aside "heavy-handed collaboration" for the sake of "better."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110056/#Comment_110056" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T11:24:06+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 11:24AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, what you're describing seems very close to what I experienced playing a Danish scenario, in Denmark, with Danes (and Swedes).

Sometimes it's just really fun to make up a character (who is usually a stock Buffy character with a little individual spark, stick them together with a bunch of similar characters, act out their interactions in a fairly predictable way, and follow the GM's plot thread to find the vampires and destroy the bad guys.  This sounds tedious when you describe it generically, but I find it very enjoyable; it's nice to alternate a game like that with something like Nobilis or Polaris, where you have to really think about what your character does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110456/#Comment_110456" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T15:10:05+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  3:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had some time to straighten out my thinking on my whole weird "collaboration is the enemy of trust" riff. It wouldn't leave my head, which usually means there's something more there to explore. Levi's post helped that along as well.<br/><br/>So when I said that, I think I was thinking about <i>mandatory</i> collaboration, the kind that's mechanized and shows up so frequently in new-skool games. That process seems, to me, to state pretty clearly, "I believe this process delivers a better product than the solitary GM doing what he's always done, and/or the publishing company doing what it has always done."<br/><br/>You'd have to unpack what "better" means in this context. I think the assumption is that there's more player buy-in if they have their hand in the setting. Pride of ownership and all that. It's clearly <i>not</i> better from the players' POV in terms of time invested (assuming players prefer to spend their time playing and not collaborating) and, in some cases, unity of editorial vision (again, assuming players can sense where one vision stops and another starts, and find that transition undesireable).<br/><br/>So, still not a conclusive relationship between trust and collaboration. Just wanted to put that out there.<br/><br/>Since trust and collaboration are probably on independent axes, I also got to thinking what a low-trust, low-collaboration game would look like: the players rely on a neutral authority (i.e. the Rules As Written, or other explicit instructions) even while a GM-figure continues to be present, but must do his job in a way that doesn't rely on his players' trust. <br/><br/>Could a GM be the sole creator in a low-trust situation? I think that's probably the Rune model: every element of play is costed out and the GM must work within an established budget, and there's definitely no collaboration with the players, who are agreeing to face whatever the GM throws at them.<br/><br/>Since that sort of crunchy tactical play has already been done (although certainly not exhausted), I'm wondering if it's possible to do something similar on the story/narrative side of things. I think I'm coming back to the design idea of a GM who is an unreliable witness on behalf of his players. Trad GMs are often powerful editorial influences on the players, but the sacred cow is that only works in a high-trust environment (i.e. the GM is looking out for the players' best interests). <br/><br/>Horror's probably a good genre for this. GM tells the players there's definitely something scary and fucked-up lurking in the dark. Players go explore and, via the rules, find nothing, thereby overriding the GM's threat of danger. The GM describes a scene to great detail, but the players are able to reveal the scene is only a hallucination, despite the GM's wishes. And vice-versa: player describes what he's doing but the GM is able to modify that, revealing that his actions are not as they seem ("I perform emergency surgery to extract the bullet" becomes "I implant a flesh-eating worm in the bullet hole").<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110457/#Comment_110457" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T15:10:27+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  3:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>I wonder if some people just love to<em>listen</em>to stories, where they can make the pictures in their own minds, but modern life provides almost no opportunities for this activity outside of roleplaying games?</blockquote>\nIf they're interacting with the stories at all, they're not just <i>listening</i>.

Sure it is: if the QM is feeding the quiz-ees' input back into a new cycle of information, that new cycle is going to turn out differently from something that the QM made up completely in a vacuum. I don't think there's any reason to <i>assume</i> that collaboration needs to be "live" or involve each collaborator communicating ideas with each and every other collaborator.

The QM and the players have markedly different <i>roles</i> in the creation of the material, but they all have a hand in creating it. <br/><br/>In the things you just mentioned, the teacher/playwright are their to transmit information to the students/audience. Gathering feedback from the information recipients is a great way for the teacher/playwright to hone their craft, but that's not what the students/audience are <i>there</i> for.<br/><br/>For it to be collaboration there needs to be a commonality of purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110504/#Comment_110504" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T20:56:58+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  8:56PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 8:57PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>Um.

Here's an example:<br/><br/>This was in a D&amp;D game from a couple years back, when I was first starting to experiment with trying to encourage more creative input from the players outside of the traditional "I get to say what my character does and the DM handles everything else" mode. One I'm thinking of in particular really grooved on setting. A big part of the gaming experience for her was "feeling like she was <i>there</i>". When that was working for her, when an evocative description of a location got her imagination fired up, she was more than happy to start adding details to the scene, bringing in minor NPCs, etc. The way she described it to me was, "a good description makes me feel like I'm really there; I start noticing other things that are in the scene and that makes me want to show them to the other players so they can feel like that too."<br/><br/>That fit right in with what I was trying to do, so I encouraged it every chance I got.

Because most of the gaming I do involves me GMing "traditional" games as collaboratively as possible, I tend to get overly defensive toward the suggestion that those kinds of games aren't collaborative. Even when that suggestion isn't there at all. \n<blockquote>It's a genuine question: The GM describes something and the players respond. Where's the collaboration, if there is any?</blockquote>\nOK. We're sitting at the gaming table; you're the GM and I'm the player. You're imagining my character in a 20' stone room with an altar in it. I'm imagining opening the bag of Cheetos. At this point, there's imagination going on, but it's not shared. Nothing is collaborative yet, either.<br/><br/>Now you describe the room you're imagining that my character is in. I imagine it too, so now we've got the whole shared imagination thingy going on. It's still not collaborative, though, because while we're both imagining the same thing, that thing we're both imagining came solely from one of us. <br/><br/>So <i>then</i> I say, "OK, my guy goes in and looks at the altar" and you're like, "OK, it's got all these spooky looking runes on it and stuff." And <i>that's</i> when it becomes collaboration. Not only are we both imagining the same thing, but the thing we're imagining is the way it is because we both had a hand in making it that way.<br/><br/>Now I suppose that's not <i>very</i> collaborative. I mean, come on, <i>you</i> get to make up a whole room and an altar and stuff and all <i>I</i> get to contribute is "uh, I look at it". But that certainly doesn't mean it's <i>not</i> collaborative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110705/#Comment_110705" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T12:11:31+00:00" title="November 30, 2007 12:11PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron:<br/><br/>Right, totally agreed on all points (and I've been a traditional-style GM/player for 27 years, so I know where you're coming from). If the players describe anything <i>at all</i> about what they're doing, that's ostensibly collaboration in the "we're sharing an activity together" sense. But the players' contribution is (only?) reactive to the creative material coming out of a single source (the GM or a published adventure).<br/><br/>The storygame version of collaboration goes quite a ways beyond the more traditional, and perhaps even widely understood, meaning of "collaboration." The stuff that's explicitly beyond the bounds of player authority in a traditional game is often put back into the players' hands in story-focused RPGs, for all kinds of reasons. The effect is so powerful that "<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">collaboration</span> putting story authority into the players' hands makes everything better all the time" has sort of snuck in as an unquestioned truth, i.e. moo.<br/><br/>And <i>sometimes </i>it's just not so. I've been extremely pleased in my recent couple years' of gaming at what comes out of collaboration. Several of my regular players have been extremely <i>displeased</i> at the new regime.<br/><br/>I really like Jason's focus on taking the cow, carving it up, and seeing what better dish you can make out if it.

The process of coming to a consensus shuffles your personal vision into the background to make it compatible with those of other participants. But your vision is *still there* and you are not in fact negotiating consensus by creating a shared space. There is no shared space. You are submitting your personal vision to assessment by the group in a process intimately connected to your group's power relations.</blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure that Malcolm's right.<br/><br/>The idea of "Shared Imagined Space" is a bigger sacred cow here than many of the others thus far discussed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110824/#Comment_110824" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T16:03:06+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go kill SIS <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4939&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">over here</a>.
