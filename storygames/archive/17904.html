They play a card and point to a location in the game and say what happens there. If no one challenges them the action happens and the turn ends. The card gives them a certain number of victory points so at the end of the game there is a winner - of sorts. Players get one challenge per turn to try and replace the action - and get the victory points for themselves. That's the idea in brief.<br/><br/>The action deck is a 54 card deck. Each card has a suggestive word or phrase and a number of victory points it gives. Examples of cards are:<br/><br/>Charge - 1vp<br/>Innuendo - 3vp<br/>I've got a plan - 1vp<br/>Betray - 3vp<br/>Look whose in trouble now - 2vp<br/>etc.<br/><br/>A player plays a card and uses the words to launch their ideas about what to do. More interesting story elements (like hurting your own character or talking rather than shooting NPCs) give more victory points. What I hope this does is help players through that awkward part of story games where players just don't know what to do next. When you have total freedom - indecision takes hold a lot. Players redraw back up to five cards after each turn. <br/><br/>If a player makes a good story in their scene no one will challenge them so good story telling is rewarded but if someone doesn't like what was said they may challenge and make up a different story for what happened. The two players then roll 2d6, the high roller wins, re-roll ties. This means the dice only stomp on player's creativity when competing players want to stomp on one another. Everyone gets a one chance to do this every turn but they don't have to and it is possible that games could happen where no dice are rolled. <br/><br/>The game continues until the story is completed or players run out of cards (which ends a game session - you can pick the story up again later if you want). So the game is time limited and because of victory points it yields a gamist winner. <br/><br/>I have some other ideas on how to move stories along but this is the basic mechanic.<br/><br/>Oh, the game context is that players have a character they champion in the story but they can make other players act. Each player is an author more than an actor. <br/><br/>What do you think? What are the holes that I'm not seeing? Is there anything here that just kills fun?<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405106/#Comment_405106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T08:30:52+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  8:30AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) If every other player can challenge every turn, there's a strong skew towards pre-play negotiations. I have to be fairly sure the (frex) three other players will like what I do, because I basically need unanimity: one player disagreeing means I have a ~42% chance of failure, two others jacks that to ... a number I can't figure, but it's HIGH! So my card doesn't matter nearly as much as how I sell it before I reveal it.<br/><br/>2) Why wouldn't I always challenge an opponent who has a VP lead, if I want to "win?" Why wouldn't EVERY player who's not in the lead challenge EVERY other player?<br/><br/>3) What happens on a challenge roll tie? "Yes, but...?"<br/><br/>4) What happens, mechanically, if a challenge roll (or rolls? See #6) is the high roll? Loss of turn? Only loss of card (i.e., "Try a different way")?<br/><br/>5) Can that same challenger(s) re-challenge? (I'd guess no... which DOES open up an interesting bluffing mechanic--I play a high-VP card I don't really want, knowing everyone will challenge it to be sure to get the high roll against me, after which I play with impunity my lower-VP card, smugly smiling.)<br/><br/>6) Simultaneous challenges or sequential? The former seems better, to me, both for the bluffing in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> and to avoid dog-piling a leader per <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>7) Any cost to challenging? (If not, why not? Free challenging incentivizes challenging everything, either for gamist or narrativist reasons.)<br/><br/>It's an interesting "story driver" idea... but the "game' part of it seems lopsided, with perverse incentives and imbalanced resource expenditures in conflicts (at the moment).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405107/#Comment_405107" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T08:58:21+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  8:58AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            8) Announcing challenge(s) timing? I'd assume you want it simultaneous and secret--like, show a white or black stone in an outstretched fist--so that the challengers don't know if they have enough to "ensure" a win (e.g., in a six-player game, not all five others would need to challenge me, but as the turn-taking player, I want them all to challenge, if I'm bluffing or just so that they don't one, two, three, four, five challenge me and, thus, put a challenge against every card in my hand.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405112/#Comment_405112" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T09:58:01+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  9:58AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your bluffing idea is intriguing and not at all what I was thinking about. I will think about it!<br/><br/>The way I'm envisioning it making a really kick ass fun story is the best defense. Not being challenged is the reward for doing this. In my play tests over the last few months I've observed that that is what happens. Also people's shyness about making things up limits challenges but these are both player imposed not rules imposed. <br/><br/>Rationally players have to challenge to win the game. If a player puts down a high VP card and you don't challenge you will lose the VP game (though maybe not the game if making a fun story is the reward of the game). Each turn starts with the first player playing a card and making up a tale. Then every other player has the option of jumping in with a challenge. They are made a resolved sequentially so if the second player challenges and wins, the third player to jump in my challenge the challenge. It pays to wait, but if no one jumps in in a minute or so the host of the game asks the next player to the left to start the next turn. That seems a little like playing chicken in cars than bluffing (which is an idea that I'm really intrigued by.<br/><br/>There is not cost to challenges. You just get one a turn. It is just a matter of the player asking themselves if they have a better idea or whither they want to be real partisan and go for the victory points. Of course you still need to make a good story to try and entertain the other players enough to leave you alone. <br/><br/>If people did challenge a lot it could stomp creative energy. I'm not that competitive a player myself. I'm happy to yield to a good story but I can see that other people aren't. I wonder if that means the game is broken.<br/><br/>The other story driver idea I'm using is to have a separate series of scene cards, that have a plot question on them. Instead of playing an action card a player can point to a scene card and build their story off of them. The victory points given start off low - 1 for the first scene - 2 for the second - etc. But the later cards give ever more points so there is little incentive to challenge early scenes but huge incentive to challenge later scenes. The guides the players to have competing view so the story as it reaches a climax. Winning the late scenes can win a game for someone who lost earlier. That alters things a little in regards to vps but not in how turns are resolved. <br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405113/#Comment_405113" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T10:12:21+00:00" title="January 31, 2013 10:12AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What I hope this does is help players through that awkward part of story games where players just don't know what to do next.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The way I'm envisioning it making a really kick ass fun story is the best defense.

It costs me a card to attempt to contribute, it costs a challenger nothing. Challenging is sequential, so there's an incentive to try to "play chicken" (I think bluff is better, but your current model doesn't LET the original narrator "go again" if successfully challenged; rather, it seems that they are just skipped over).<br/><br/>It wasn't clear to me on first read that the challenger had to offer an alternative narration--and pony up a card of their own?--in the course of challenging. So if it's card-for-card, then (again) I challenge everything because I want MY VPs (as challenger) to go to me, not yours to you.<br/><br/>A good mechanic should present choice, not automatic play: it either presents a risk/reward decision or a trade-off or otherwise presents a tension of incentives.<br/><br/>I suggest you flowchart the whole turn sequence out, and it will be more apparent to you where perverse incentives lie. (Also, the whole timing and sequencing will be more clear to us, minimizing back-and-forth as you elucidate rules details.)<br/><br/>Further, if your playtest experience is different than what we anticipate from the RAW, then you need to tease out what parts of satisfying play are coming from your table culture and what are from the RAW. Anything from the former either needs to be codified into rules or advised as a "way to play charitably" (though the latter way is weaker than having the RAW drive "appropriate" play).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405135/#Comment_405135" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T13:53:11+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  1:53PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now the rules as written don't have the challenger play a card.

When a challenge is made they give their dice to one side or other. The players roll their dice pool - high roller wins. This could make for a very lop sided affair.

But I feel like the VP element really muddies the waters.<br/><br/>For example, one of my gaming group is keen to join in but (coming from a lifetime of Warhammer and board games) his storytelling isn't so strong. Perfect for Action Cards! Except... his competitive nature means he's going to be more focused on winning over telling a good story. (It doesn't help he's the joker of our group and will laugh off any nonsensical narrative choices he makes for the sake of scoring).<br/>Someone else in the same group enjoys using RPGs to express themselves, but doesn't have much experience with shared storytelling and sometimes finds it difficult to get their voice heard. Perfect for Action Cards! Except... the VP mechanic means she's going to be challenged at every turn, because it's in the other players interest (especially Mr competitive, above) to do so.<br/>Neither of these people are SOBs, they're fine folk with roughly similar goals towards RPGs. It's just their approaches to gaming are very different.<br/><br/>Maybe instead of a 'challenging' mechanic, players could have a chance to show their approval of a scene, instead? (I'm thinking of something the reverse of contempt tokens, from the Quiet Year.) Something like this:<br/>- A player narrates an action from a card as described. Every card has a VP score on it as you describe (more interesting options have higher scores - I really like that idea, too.)<br/>- After a player narrates an action, everyone else must either approve or disapprove it. Every approval earns the narrator one more VP. Provided they get at least one approval, they also get the value on the card. If no-one approves , they get nothing that round (not even the score on the card.)<br/>- After the game, everyone cashes in their VP for sweets (or just play with smarties or something!)<br/><br/>Obviously the idea's not perfect (especially if you have a small group) but I hope this is useful nonetheless. (One final aside - I recommend <a href="http://www.spiralgalaxygames.co.uk/acatalog/Braggart_Card_Game_Description.html" rel="nofollow">Braggart</a> - it's got a similar concept, but played differently.

More strictly: If the roll is not a tie, the odds for the defender and challenger are equal: 630/1,296. The odds of having to roll twice are 36/1,296, which is 1/36. The odds of having to roll three times are 1/1,296. The odds of having to roll four times are 1/46,656. For any given roll, there's a 1/36 chance you'll have to roll one more time, but the odds of having to do that indefinitely are fleetingly trivial. At the limit, that possibility approaches zero, and of the remaining cases, exactly half are for the defender, half for the challenger.<br/><br/>The odds of winning a second challenge (to the same play) also approach one-half, which means that if two players challenge me on the same play, I only have a 50%x50%= 25% chance to get my way. Half it again for each additional challenge.<br/><br/>If there's no cost to challenge, but you can only do it once, there is some incentive for the other players to either take turns challenging you, or to line up challenges if you play a high-point card. That means it might be a challenge to score any point at all, but the incentive seems to me to be for the player to play all cards in hand during a turn. There's not really any reason not to, right? And I can imagine two strategies, in addition to the bluffing trick that was mentioned earlier: play your cards in either ascending or descending order of point value. In either case, your opponents have either to blow their challenges early, letting you slip something in at the end of turn, or save their challenges to prevent that, which means you might nab some points earlier.<br/><br/>If you could only play a certain number of cards from your hand each turn, that might change the strategy. It might also make it more interesting if the cards included things like, "You get +2 vp, and one opponent of your choice gets +1 vp", or "You take -1 vp and so does everybody else", and so on. Those kinds of cards would influence your opponent's incentives for challenging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405182/#Comment_405182" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T05:56:44+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  5:56AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Creases - Yeah the odds of winning any particular challenge are essentially 50/50. My only reason for using 2d6 is that for some reason I can't quite explain rolling 2d6 is fun - a lot more fun than 1d6 or flipping a coin. It's weird. <br/><br/>Jbinc - I can see what your saying about how VPs will draw the competitive player to them like flies to shit and how they can get in the way of the quite player. What I've realized is that my group are mainly not hyper competitive players. "Fair play" what ever that means is more important to us. Building and maintaining the relationship rather than proving our manhood. Using Victory points needs to help play for it to be included. I think it can because of the structure it brings to interactions but that comes at a cost. More players alienated.<br/><br/>Damn!

If they won the challenge they would keep their bet card but also get VPs from the card they played. If they lost then the winner would get the VPs from the card they played but also get to pick up the bet card. That would leave them with 6 cards in their hand for the next turn and the loser would be down to 3 cards. This could work but it seems a bit clunky to me. It might be hard to explain it. <br/><br/>Chet suggested that if the challenging player loses, that they lose their next turn. Boco and I agreed that this would be hard to remember because the challenger might not be the next player up - who would remember it then?<br/><br/>Early this morning I woke up thinking about it. I always want the simplest procedure possible. <br/><br/>Why not have the challenger play an action card to make a challenge. If they win, they get the VP's from the first player's card (they pick it up and put it in their pile of won cards). The card they played would be discarded and thus be cycled back though the game. Their card would need to be discarded to avoid creating a perverse reward that incentivised playing a big VP card every chance you had. If the challenger lost then the winner would get the VP from their card AND the VP from the card the challenger played. So the card played is the wager card. This doesn't add any new components to the game but makes the challenger risk something real when challenging. It might be a 1VP card so the cost isn't too high while still being real.<br/><br/>There is a local gamer here abouts - Bob - who is one of those highly competitive players. When I imagined being him - and having to risk rewarding the player your trying to stop - it seemed that every a small cost would be enough to deter frivolous challenges. This will mean I need to include an action deck with all my games - a bit more work cause they all need some kind of card art - but doable. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405195/#Comment_405195" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T09:10:23+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  9:10AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha yeah, it might be interesting to see both Bob and my competitive mate at the same table..! <br/><br/>That last idea makes more sense to me - higher risk, higher reward - but I'm really interested in what you said about your group being focused on fair play. Like you say, do Victory Points help build and maintain that strong group relationship you have? If so, cool - how can that element be reinforced further (if not, how could gameplay be pushed along instead?) Also, is this something you're exclusively looking to create for your group as a hobby, or something that (as your last comment about card art suggests) you might sell in the future?<br/><br/>The mechanic makes me think you could use this as a way to supplement other RPGs as much as create it as a game in itself, kind of like Rory's Story Cubes but more detailed. The GM could deal out a hand to each player in addition to their playbooks or whatever, and if a player is stuck, they can use what's on a card as a jumping-off point. (Maybe the VP reward is translated into free XP or something.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405200/#Comment_405200" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T10:07:52+00:00" title="February  1, 2013 10:07AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris,<br/><br/>It seems to me you don't want competition so much as refinement of the narrative, so I suggest changing the language and procedure to not be a challenge, but an amendment. <br/><br/>For example: When a player wants to amend the initial player's action, she suggests changing one part of the original description and keeping another, both should be mentioned - which turns this into a "constructive criticism". The initial player can accept the amendment (netting both players +1 VP) or refuse it. If he refuses the amending player can discard an action card to force the issue, turning it into a roll-off as you describe. And the winner gets +1 VP and gets their way in the narrative. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405213/#Comment_405213" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T11:14:57+00:00" title="February  1, 2013 11:14AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mechanic is definitely something that can be grafted into any RPG. In this case it is used as a stand alone game but in April I'm going to use a version of it to run a Miniatures story game based on "The Last of the Mohicans" (the book rather than the movie). It will handle all the action - combat and non-combat alike. <br/><br/>I'm definitely going to add in the other player suggestion ideas into the rules - since that always happens and is fun. I didn't have it at first because it is one of those implied things -fair play what what. I don't anticipate the action cards being a stand alone product themselves but I will include them in the story game products I sell at Gen Con (Hamster Press - home of stuffed animals and dragons!) The big project I'll use it in first is "Fairy Tale Assassin League" which is kind of a cross between the TV show "Once upon a time" and "Sin city". Tinkerbell with a gun - a big gun! But the game only works if the rules help it work rather than get in the way (which is what I think has happened with previous products.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405272/#Comment_405272" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T20:10:05+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  8:10PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2013 8:11PM by Callan_S.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd ditch the gamist notion - it adds nothing to the story generated through play (since it comes <i>after play has ended!</i>), indeed if the gamist notion were actually pursued, it'd make story a <i>secondary </i>concern!<br/><br/>I'd make it something like that every real life hour of play (or some time increment), whoever has the most VP gains a story element token. The player can use these to add an element to the story. Or they can use them to give <i>someone else</i> a reroll if the other persons idea was constested. At most you can only have three story element tokens at a time. Perhaps have a 'Contributor Stars' system, where they can convert three story element tokens into a star. This is simply an ego gratification element, though an accurate one as they would indeed be a good contributor. However, it is not the main point of the game - you'd have to have text telling people not to latch onto this like a pitbull as if its the big thing that matters. It's just a nice thing. Anyway, at the end of each hour everyones VP is reset to zero again.<br/><br/>Not sure of some of the critique here - seems some 'glass half empty' views. Glass half full is that you have a ~50% chance of getting your artistic creation into play, instead of just cow towing to the status quo. You can have a genuine voice that can't just be shut out by pure whimsical 'oh, we don't want to listen'.<br/><br/>I think it begs to be playtested and I hope I hear about such playtests in the very near future! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405297/#Comment_405297" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-02T11:51:05+00:00" title="February  2, 2013 11:51AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would back the game up to just the cards.

I've played games of Fiasco where I could clearly see the hierarchy of popularity come into play in who got listened to. I'm not a regular in Games on Demand and most of what I said was not acknowledged. Other individuals were heard so to play the game I went along with them. If I hadn't it would not have been a fun game. Challenges even the playing field.<br/><br/>I don't mention the gamist term in my rules. I just keep it in my mind to try and see how competitive players can break the game.<br/><br/>Jason - I do value interesting story elements like betrayal and things like "I'll be right back" more highly (3vp) than things like good luck, charge, rest and recover (1vp). My hope is that this will encourage players to do more interesting (probably more self destructive) things in the game. I've also played around with only one card played a turn versus more cards played. There is not clear winning between these two methods so I'll likely err on the side of what people seem to naturally do. So far that is to play a card when challenging. They just do it so I want to let them.<br/><br/>I've had another day to think about having the challenger play a card to challenge and that that is the card they are risking. If they win - their card is discarded but they get the first player's card. If they lose, the first player gets both cards in victory points. This seems real clean to me and easy to explain. As long as it doesn't kill creative energy or fun I'll likely implement it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405386/#Comment_405386" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T11:50:19+00:00" title="February  4, 2013 11:50AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the challenge mechanic sounds OK.<br/><br/>I'm less sure about the game overall. You hint here and there that people are playing characters in the story (e.g. "my character"). Is that the case? How does that interact with the various narrations and cards on so forth?<br/><br/>I've tried my hand at designing a whole variety of games kind of along these lines. The main thing that I think needs to be nailed down is whether you're more interested in creating a good narrative/story or in the competitive point-collection aspect of the game. <br/><br/>(For example, if someone finds a way to weave in an incongruous story element because it's worth a lot of points, even though it's really kind of a stretch for the narrative, is that a good move we should applaud, or do we groan and ask the player if they're sure they don't want to narrate something different?)<br/><br/>I would have very different comments depending on your answer.<br/><br/>If a good story is desired, the main thing I see missing in this game is any kind of incentive or support for players to collaborate with each other and build on each others' ideas. (Unless the cards themselves include this kind of thing, of course, but we don't know since you haven't really told us what the cards are like.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405420/#Comment_405420" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T18:06:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  6:06PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will start <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17924/action-cards-fairy-tale-assassin-league-a-dangerously-sexy-game#Item_1" rel="nofollow">another thread</a> that gives a more detailed example of one of the games I'm making.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405456/#Comment_405456" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T06:44:13+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  6:44AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I've tried my hand at designing a whole variety of games kind of along these lines.

I think I posted somewhere around here about it at one point.<br/><br/>The rub of it was this: After the game is ended, a deck of cards is dealt around to the players. There are more cards than players, like maybe 15 cards total. they're all dealt out and it doesn't matter if someone ends up with an extra or not. The cards themselves are set up to make a nod to the game being a movie or TV show and ask questions about different aspects of the fiction just created and its reception by audiences.<br/><br/>Some of them are frankly meant to be silly. Each player looks at the cards they have in hand, then picks one they feel somehow applies to contributions made by the player to their right. They read the card aloud and then answer any questions associated with it, relating it to the contributions of that player.<br/><br/>After that round of cards and descriptions based on them, everyone simply votes one player Most Valuable Player for the overall experience of the session.<br/><br/>The idea here is to encourage/acknowledge lightweight competition in an essentially co-operative story makng activity. Everyone gets at least one warm-fuzzy ( acknowledgement) from the first round, while the actual victor is determined by group vote at the end. As it is an MVP award, it really is just a first among equals concept and really does rely on working well with others.<br/><br/>Not sure if you can work this concept into your game or not Chris.<br/><br/>I would point out that there are some successful mainstream games that have a very lightweight approach to victory conditions. Apples to Apples come to mind. Competitive in theory, but in practice not terribly so. For something revolving around the fun of co-operative story making, that might be the best way to go.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
