Poetic, even. How, in fact, <b>do</b> we come to care for our characters?<br/><br/>My list is similar to yours. I'll post it later.<br/><br/>EDIT: Eric Provost and I were chatting once (there's a thread around here somewhere) about basically how to get the feel of a huge lengthy campaign but in a shortened campaign of 5-15 sessions: And how that mostly amounts to Caring for your Characters and Caring about What's Going On (with other NPCs, mainly; harder in a mini-campaign, since there's simply not as much face time as in a year-long campaign). We kinda floundered about for a bit, but I think this discussion is a great first step to determining how we care about our characters in the games we play, which may naturally lead us to conclusions that we can bring to other games.<br/><br/>In other words, people, bring it!<br/><br/>Also, if you post, personally, like Mark I'd love to see your Example Games. <br/>I will assume that you're not just listing games you haven't played much where you think that, when played, it will make you care about your character (<b>BAD</b>), but rather the game that made you, specifically, care about the character you played in that game in the specific way you list (<b>GOOD</b>). Vignettes are fine, too.<br/><br/>Hot damn, I dunno what it is, but this discussion intro is hitting some sweet spot for me.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>
