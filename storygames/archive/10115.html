During the war, a group of Nazi scientists were developing a weapon (i'm thinking a bomb or something similar) using unstable materials mined from "somewhere else" (another dimension, hell, whatever).  They got as far as preliminary tests with this weapon before the war ended and they were, for the most part, carted off to prison or shipped to America to make rockets.  Anyway, one scientist escaped with some of the material and some plans for the weapon and hid out in the Berlin underground, starting a secret lab and planning to finish the weapon (and, ostensibly, use it to overthrow the powers who were occupying Berlin and blah blah blah hurrah for the Reich).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe gist of the weapon was that it was an airborne pathogen meant to kill relatively indiscriminately (though, the plan was eventually to "attune" it with occult magic to the master race so it would only wipe out those who were unworthy) but in reality, the bomb actually contained semi-intelligent spores who were able to take over the brain and bodily functions of a handful of the victims of the weapon.  Sort of a Body Snatchers situation.  The spores ultimate goal fits with the Nazi scientist - to finish and detonate the bomb, kill as many people as they can, host more spores and eventually open a proper portal to the spore homeworld and Kill All Humans.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking that the Scientist is the main antagonist, though he himself is probably infected with the spores.  He's got a handful of assistants, who were once living humans he was testing on but who have died and become host to the spores.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe RPA has managed to figure out that there's a secret lab and a scientist (because he's been arranging to have "test subjects" delivered by a corrupt russian officer) and sent a team to investigate.  The scientist and his goons killed all but one member of that team and converted the living member into a host.  The game is going to start with a bang - the PCs in a tunnel underground searching for the missing team, a bomb being triggered and the tunnels flooding and them trying to get out alive.  After that it'll be a race against time to find the scientist before he completes the bomb.  On top of that, the CIA has agents who (in a sort of Weyland-Yutani twist) want to get their hands on the bomb to use as potential leverage against the USSR.  There's sort of a three-way race going on that'll play on the loyalties and trust of the team as well (what do they do once they have the weapon?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome key NPCs are going to be the Scientist, the Russian Officer, the CIA agents and ... well, I need some more grabby bits, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any thoughts?  I'd love any input.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224493/#Comment_224493" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T11:09:53+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 11:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the game starts after all the cool stuff has already happened?  <br/><br/>You've got a brain-controlling parasite from an unknowable dimension - first of all, fuck the Nazis, this spore hive mind thing is a way cooler threat that would make quick work of the Aryan dupes who invited it to Earth.  I'd have it in charge, infecting people, slowly building a network to get at the RPA, which it astutely realizes is the only threat it faces.  So you've got cold war paranoia, "is he or isn't he?" action like in The Thing, awesome potential for literal corruption within the RPA (I'd totally have some high official get seduced by a spore-infected swain), and so forth.  There's a slow build, maybe a series of unrelated cases of very odd behavior in people close to the RPA and later in low level operatives, all of which forms a trail pointing backward to the fungi's hidden lair.  <br/><br/>That every faction wants to either control the hive mind spore monster or (worse) make a deal with it is a given.  The only sensible thing to do is root it out and burn every trace, but making that argument is going to be tough...I'd actually let the confrontation with the spore monster be easy, and let the dawning realization that it has already infected British General Staff Berlin be the real problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224495/#Comment_224495" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T11:15:34+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 11:15AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had intended the game to be a race against time to find and stop the bomb before it was unleashed, but there's a certain appeal to the damage being less "BANG NOW YOU ARE A SPORE" and more insidious than that.  The increasing paranoia about who is and isn't a Host is a pretty good source for some squickyness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that the Nazis have all but expired, yeah, the Scientist who snuck away with the pathogen is nothing but a pawn of the Spores now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat changes should I make to implementing this, then?  I mean, I need to introduce the concepts (the spores, the way they spread, etc) to the players in a way that's exciting and then give them some concrete goals to work towards.  At least a framework for them to play in while they pursue their hidden agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, too, I haven't really nailed down my play style for this yet.  I mean, I'm leaning towards noir or body horror but I have a feeling my players are going to appreciate a pulpier approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224498/#Comment_224498" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T11:30:24+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 11:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 11:31AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cold City should be all about the paranoia.  In my opinion it plays best when the evil Nazi arcano-tech takes a backseat to the natural distrust and enmity in postwar Berlin.  <br/><br/>At some point a PC or all of them need to be infected.  Do it through sex.  That'll put the hammer down and make them really want to figure it out before the voices in their heads overpower them.  Or infect their loved ones.  Get all Village of the Damned on them.  <br/><br/>I'd structure a set of victims/clues/events that lead back to the lair, which in turn offers the big reveal that it has spread further than they thought.  Make sure whatever the solution is and whoever has been compromised, it is happening to multiple factions that don't believe or trust one another.  When the Americans beg the Soviets to sanitize their Freidrichshain barracks with fuel-air explosives, that's going to be a hard sell, and the clock is ticking.  let them never be quite sure they've got every last spore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224502/#Comment_224502" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T11:45:18+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 11:45AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree - the whole infected angle should really just be a metaphor for the paranoia of the setting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like the PCs to come in visceral contact with the spores before they know that they can be infected.  I'm really hoping for a disquieting moment of revelation when they all realize they've been potentially compromised.  Or, even better, just one or two of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like, too, to engineer a sort of false ending where they dispatch the Evil Nazi Mad Scientist and think that things are all better but really, they're just starting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224590/#Comment_224590" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T18:16:45+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  6:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really love the way you're going with this whole "Spores = Everything America feared about Communism" thing.  There's so much milage in that.<br/><br/>I've only run three games of Cold City, but I found my most successful games were the ones where there was an obvious impediment to just running in and gunning everything down.  Whether that's because spore-hosts can be decontaminated, or because maybe they're still people, and someone's loved ones are infected, or maybe because the spores control another super-weapon of some kind, so there's an element of mutually assured destruction.  <br/><br/>Cold City is one of the few games where you can really have PCs getting infected by mind control spores on the table as a viable option.  You just get the player to re-write their faction agenda from whatever it was to "Serve the Spores", and you're golden.  Instant double agent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
