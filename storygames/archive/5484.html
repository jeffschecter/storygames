John Harrison, which are sort of a reaction to Moorcock's fantasy novels -- they take place in the same city, but the city is described differently in each one, although names and locations keep reoccuring with variations.  Perhaps some variation of this would work for you -- there's always a great port city ruled by an enlightened despot, and it's always got the same name, but sometimes it feels like Ankh-M orpork and sometimes like Stygia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Astinus" title="Astinus"><img alt="Astinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Astinus">Astinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123381/#Comment_123381" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T11:01:37+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:01AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 have multiple games in the same setting, although most of them are wargames. Still, there's a tabletop RPG for both. The whole lot of them have been pulled off admirably (less a video game or two that kinda sucked, but I regress) and with little inconsistency in elements of the settings. What I've noticed is that while the mechanics and focus of the various games are all quite different from the others in their setting, none of them have really exceptionally detailed characters in terms of mechanics. Of course, individual character complexity isn't something that works well in wargames, but the absence of page long skill lists for one person helps a lot in converting a particular race or piece of equipment from one system to another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123387/#Comment_123387" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T11:12:37+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I think you're right about Uni, which I also love to death although IMO it's a bit on the complicated side.</blockquote>\nThe genesis of Uni was collaborative world-building, so it should work out well.<br/><br/>The other possibility is to just free-form it, putting someone (probably you) in charge of adjudicating the impact of a given game scenario on the world.  A variation on this theme is to allow the players to establish the Scale of the impact of their scenario.<br/><br/>I capitalize Scale, because it's a term from Trollbabe.  It works like this.  The campaign has a Scale setting, which starts with "an individual".  A given adventure has impact equal to the Scale.  In between adventures, any player may increase the Scale.  At the upper end of the Scale are things like cities and nations and the like.<br/><br/>I'm sure that you could loot from this for your Play Now world.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124739/#Comment_124739" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T08:19:18+00:00" title="February  6, 2008  8:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I realized late in the game that I don't want just the 3 games, I want the whole shebang.

If you're a fighter, you use d10s for everything, and use the Fighter Rules. The wizard uses d4's and the Wizard Rules. But the rules for (say) combat allow everyone to roll as they normally would, and the game handles it properly. Each class' subset is relatively small.<br/><br/>The idea of different areas having different rules was actually something that was suggested in old D&amp;D supplements as a way of upgrading to the new core rules. "You've traveled to a distant land where everything works differently!"<br/><br/>In a vaguely related story, I once ran a universe-hopping fantasy game with the express purpose of trying out different rules. It started in Everway, because the characters you get there are pretty easy to transfer. The plan was to go through Talislanta, Blue Rose, Donjon, Arcana Evolved, Burning Wheel, Dying Earth (comedy break), LotR, and L5R. I had no idea which one I'd use for the last session. Unfortunately some of the players had to drop, but it was fun while it lasted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124890/#Comment_124890" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T05:22:17+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  5:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the last session of our Itras By campaign, we used different systems each scene.

I can't find the link right now, but it's somewhere on Lumpley.com. <br/><br/>Our group has done this a few times too. We resurrected some D20 pulp characters for a pulp game of TSOY, then moved them to SOTC when it came out. In a later game in the same series, we pulled in a a PC and his demons from a Mu game to serve as arch-villain. This kind of cross-game play works really well and requires minimal extra effort. The trick is to remain true to the spirit of the characters when you cross and not worry about what's on the sheet. <br/><br/>I wonder if it's worth trying to codify this portability. What would you end up with? A game with mini-games? A setting with interfaces to games?<br/><br/>A lot of games treat setting creation as a sort of mini-game. Making ships for Galactic is loads of fun. Setting up the world for Shock sounds pretty cool. Dogs character creation includes a conflict as part f the process.<br/><br/>What if you expanded this setup game into a full game on its own, then let the players choose a system to play in? What about making a game that serves as character creation for some other game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
