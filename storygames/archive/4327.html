In keeping with the lower key nature, PCs will start off as mortals, but rise to greater stature as their ties to the Gods grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt starts with the Amnesiacs with character sheets idea I bantered around here for a while, and then proceeds to the protection and media-whoring of Paris Hilton.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's more work to do still, but some of it will have to wait until I know what the PCs are going to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone that's chipped in ideas to make this possible! Keep 'em coming if you think of something. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
