This is something I have seen before, as an implication rather than as an explicit statement, and it confuses me, because I just can't see it.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being dumb? Maybe I'm missing something? Maybe no one is claiming this in the first place?<br/><br/>Why don't I see a conflict, two main reasons<br/><br/>(1) Most importantly because I don't see the interest in a story that has characters (as opposed to a story about a whole culture or whatever) that is not *all about* those characters, and if it all about them, then there is nothing to stop you being immersed in them too. I can live and breathe my character, and in the process of doing that tell a fascinating story about him or her. I can live from moment to moment and still bear in mind the goals and story arcs of what we are doing, and the eventual end that my character may come to, whether or not my character would like it. <br/><br/>I don't see anything magical in this, it's just what we do when we RP. I can't think of a campaign I've been in (since I was a child anyway) where the players were not always playing with this double perspective, what do *I the character* want and what do *I the player* want and what does *I the story* want. Sure there can be a tension there, but its a good tension and most people have no trouble with it at all (as suggested on the Player vs. Actor thread). Playing with one half of your mind in the character and the other in the story (or any other weighted split you like), is just what we do.<br/><br/>(2) People are good at following many different roles at once, it's what we all do all the time. In work I am an employee, but also I am me, and I can simultaneously hold two sets of goals, interests, and even viewpoints at the same time while there (e.g. I can hold the views of my company on a subject, and my own views, at once). Similarly in a game 99% of the time paying attention to both the story and my character at the same time is no harder than playing and keeping an eye on the clock for the bus at the same time.<br/><br/>But maybe others don't feel the same way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134781/#Comment_134781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T03:14:14+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  3:14AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very close to a discussion or two I've had two days ago, once I make a long coherent post about it (and other related stuff), I'll link.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134784/#Comment_134784" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T03:37:49+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  3:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 3:38AM by droog.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>But maybe others don't feel the same way?</blockquote>\nLots, apparently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134785/#Comment_134785" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T04:06:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  4:06AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Lots, apparently.</blockquote>Yep, though I never really got it either.

Or, rather... Immersion has never been well defined. There are a lot of discussion all over the net about the subject. And this term gets locally defined by everyone using it. Which means that discussions about it rarely illuminate. People talk past each other constantly. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's despite the fact that there definitely is a phenomenon, or more than one, that seems to fit the term. So I think that people will continue to hack away at the problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the purposes of the discussion that you're coming from, David, however, there are a couple of potential points of view that bear looking at.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Immersion Broken by Authoring - <br/>\nThere are some who claim that, whatever Immersion is, for them it's broken when they are forced by play to consider the game at all from outside of their character's POV. No, this definitely isn't what many people mean by immersion, but it's a very common part of the definition for many people. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor these people, they do not want the responsibility for doing anything other than "playing my character." Because that's the part of play that they find interesting. They see the dichotomy between player and GM as being that the GM exists to "Play the world" so that they don't have to do any of that. There are various reasons why one might want this as a creative mode (jncluding "feeling the pain" below), but often the reason is that it supports the illusion that the game world is an objectively real place. It makes the characters and world seem like they have a life of their own. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Sympathy vs Empathy vs Actually Feeling the Pain - <br/>\nSympathy means that we understand the pain of another, and feel for them that they feel pain. But we don't really know what the pain is like. Empathy is slightly deeper where we feel for the character because we've been through what they've been through, and so our feeling for them is more personal and accurate, and may evoke emotions in ourselves that are caused by the pain, or at least the memory of the pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's an even deeper level... no, we don't feel the pain of our character when they get hit by a weapon... it'd take somebody really masochistic to want that from play. There are people, however, who make themselves associate so closely with the character that they're no longer feeling "for" the character, they *are* the character, effectively, and feel the emotions of the character. When the character breaks up, they actually feel like somebody broke up with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow this last level is probably vanishingly rare. If it does happen, it probably only happens for very short bursts of what we sometimes call "channeling." And it actually often involves players being in trance states, or other altered levels of consciousness. I'm quite certain that if we put them on a encephelogram, that we'd clearly see their brainwave state change when they hit this level. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've been there, actually, and it's extremely pleasurable. In a sort of drug-induced euphoria way. I think it simply trips certain brain chemicals. But I digress...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that, for these people, any sort of "outside" interference in concentrating on "being" the character ruins the chance to get to this sort of state. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what you're calling immersion in yourself, David, is really probably more at the "Sympathy" level. You don't want to actually feel the pain that the characters are feeling directly. You feel sorry for the character, but you don't feel like you just broke up with somebody, or had a loved one die. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point being that the player who is looking to "immerse" by some of the above definitions will eschew keeping the story arc in mind, etc. It may be true that some people are capable of shifting back and forth very quickly between these states, too. You might be one of them. But consider, also, that if you don't find it fun to be a GM, as many people feel, that you might feel that way because you do not like making up "Story Arcs." Feeling much more comfortable simply characterizing your character. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... sure, for some people they probably both "immerse" by some definition, and also can keep the story arc and such in mind, and play to both of those things effectively. But many people do not like to do so, or just aren't interested, or it actively messes with their fun to do any "Authoring" level activity at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where the dichotomy lies with this sort of play, and nowhere else. It's much simpler, therefore, to think of "immersion" in this context as that sort of play where people simply do not want author stance play. But if that messes with your own personal definition of Immersion, then think of it as "non-story" play vs "Story and character play." <br/>\n<br/>\nDon't let the semantics of the term confuse. There is a real dichotomy here, no matter what the definitions of the term. Can people both "immerse" by some definition and be story-conscious? Sure. But not for everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134803/#Comment_134803" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T06:40:05+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  6:40AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>What no one wants to be the bad guy and just say is that this can be an incredibly self-centered stand to take, since, at minimum, one other person to constantly cater to that player, and possibly more, especially in a tabletop game situation.

Yes generally I'm probably in the Sympathy-Empathy range, but not always. I've been so angry at things in character I've left the building, I've been so distraught at things happening to my character I've cried, I've fallen in love in character and found it disturbingly like being in love out of character.

We're a little spoiled in that we've got a few people who really do enjoy GMing a game and do a great job with it, which means that we can support players who just want to focus on their character and interact with the game world solely through that character's actions.  If someone doesn't like doing the kind of stuff involved in Authoring and does like doing the stuff involved in playing a character, this is only a problem if the game <i>requires</i> that everyone participate in Authoring.  Personally, I like doing Authoring stuff better when I'm the GM in a trad game than I have in the more-collaborative systems we've tried.  (Although maybe that's because I can't really have fun in the game unless my friends are having fun too, and some of them simply can't have fun with Authoring...I don't know.)<br><br>And to address komradebob's post, I don't think it can really be called selfish unless the person "catering" to the player is getting absolutely nothing back from the experience -- which is, in my experience, hardly ever the case.

Being the guy who plays the world and provides the opposition is a kick, and just because it's a different kind of fun than what the players are having doesn't make it a lesser fun.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134830/#Comment_134830" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T07:59:44+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  7:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike makes very good points. Immersion is also a hasty, personal thing that happens inside one's head. It's hard to quantify and it's hard to generalize - and thus, very hard to compare. More food for thought:<br><br>In the simplest form, character immersion can be thought as avatar play. You act as yourself in a fictional envinroment (and LARPs take this one step further, since the envinroment is not fully fictional). Trying to model your psyche away from your own and towards some kind of fictional image of a person is the central challenge.<br/><br/>The problem with storytelling is that no such thing exists in our reality - we can't mold the events of our life according to how we want it to go. There's no author stance here - if you walk into cafeteria and get hit by a car on the way, there's no story there - car comes from somewhere and bump, you're broken carcass of a man. Since character immersion is trying to be like a real world experience, only in an imagined world, storytelling is initially an alien concept to it. But this really is a sliding scale and probably depends a lot about personal preferences. Some players want to be total black boxes, some want some control, some want more. It's also an aesthetic issue.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134833/#Comment_134833" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T08:04:28+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:04AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 8:05AM by komradebob.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>And to address komradebob's post, I don't think it can really be called selfish unless the person "catering" to the player is getting absolutely nothing back from the experience -- which is, in my experience, hardly ever the case.

You can have an extremely traditional set of rpg mechanics and still have very self-centered players.

Player-as-consumer is essentially treating gaming the same way, except there is no reciprocity.

My definition of character immersion is being able to unconsciously, reflexively, automatically portray a character. My definition of deep immersion is doing everything reflexively, unconsciously, automatically. So my argument below was about a very particular form of immersion. Other types of immersion are irrelevant for my argument below, (including deep immersion without character immersion, or character immersion without deep immersion). And I have had at least one person claim sincerely that they my model does not apply to them, so YMMV. That said it works for me and at least half a dozen others:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy claim was then it is hard to consciously manipulate elements of the system that can not be interpreted within the character model while both deep immersed and  character immersed. Since story elements generally are not interpretable by the character model (the character usually doesn't understand they are inside a story, and have powers to change the story, and even if they did, might not understand the concept of there being an audience they are trying to entertain) and oftentimes seem to require conscious thought (Player Bob just saw Pan's Labyrnth last night; if I narrate in some stuff from that movie it'll entertain him!)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuoting myself:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Well, there is a phenomenon that it can be hard to do constant, deep (character) immersion and respond to PLAYER-level rewards. Because while deeply immersed, it's hard (or I would claim, axiomatically/definitionally impossible) to consciously think about player-level ("metagame") issues. (I do think it is possible to subconsciously/intuitively respond to player-level rewards while deeply immersed, but there's still a limit to how adroit one can be at maximally responding to rewards that have no in-character interpretation) So if you have a reward structure that gives player-level only rewards, a deeply immersed player will be less responsive to the reward system then she would be she was not character immersed.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nOn the issue of selfishness, I'll point out that while I am deep in character immersed, I don't really care about whether others are generating a "awesome story" as opposed to a "good story" or even a "mediocre story." It's hard for me to make a special effort to contribute to the story (since I can only do direct story changes that are so simple or intuitive I can do them unconsciously) but in turn, I don't really care if others fail to make the special effort. So it's selfish in one sense (I'm expending mental energy to increase my own enjoyment [alot] that could in principal been used to increase others enjoyment [a little]) but it's not as if I expect other players to entertain me. I'm quite happy with a social contract that says "everyone focus on their own enjoyment, subject to some minimum constraints." If the group demands a contract that says "Everyone ignore their own fun, and just try to entertain each other. If we all do this it'll be awesome!" then that's probably going to be inconsistent with immersion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's tied to the notion that I'm in the camp that calls these games "hippy games." I could care less about good stories; what I am interested in is systems that smooth over logistical issues like balanced scene time, pacing, facilitating communication, so people don't have to spend conscious effort handling these things. An extreme example being is if the system handles logistics so smoothly that a GM is not required, that's a big step forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134855/#Comment_134855" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T08:53:24+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:53AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 8:55AM by komradebob.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a short period, I enjoy it too.

It's hard to describe. Each of the different kinds of immersion is a neat altered state of consciousness, but character + deep leads to a particularly peculiar altered state of awareness. At least for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the OP is referring to is I think "character immersion" (character actions come to him reflexively) withOUT "deep immersion" (He needs to consciously "still bear in mind the goals and story arcs")<br/>\n<br/>\nMy holy grail is character immersion + "narrative immersion" (reflexively, subconsciously altering the character and setting to behave according to certain narrative goals). To some degree this is necessary anyway (like reflexively avoiding certain taboo topics, like rape) but the goal is to expand the set of narrative issues I can handle subconsciously. But there will always be a limit I think; I could always do better handling narrative stuff if I focussed my full conscious mind toward them, and some story mechanics seem to practically demand complex conscious manipulation. The goal is to find story mechanics that are so incredibly intuitive that they can be handled reflexively.

I think it's more helpful to think in those terms than about selfishness.  (And BTW, it is fascinatingly paradoxical in the context of a performance for an audience.  In the context of a game around the table, it seems almost tautological.)<br>\n<br>\n2) In improv, a player is called upon to be simultaneously "in character" (react in the moment, act naturally, etc) and consider the story arc (find conflict, look for an ending).  Put another way, they must be both actor and writer (as well as director, set designer, etc).  I think it's certainly possible to do the same in RPGs.  It's also clearly a skill, requiring practice to develop.<br>\n<br>\nSteven                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134869/#Comment_134869" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T10:08:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 10:08AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 10:17AM by JDCorley.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I see it more like accepting a bunch of beers at the bar, but never picking up a round.<br><br>And doing it every Friday.</br></br></blockquote>\nReally?

The assumption of most players are that, since in order to get immersed in the games they are familiar with they must ignore the system as much as possible and "get into character" is the way to do that, the assumption is that is what must be done to get immersed.  <br><br>So, when games come along with a new approach, using system as a way to enforce/support story, the reaction is often: "Whoa, hey, if I have to think about anything that's not my character, like the system or authorship over the world, it's going to take me out of the immersion (because that is how it works in all the other games I've played, going back to learning how to roleplay in D&amp;D)."<br><br/>But I have never seen that actually happen.  There's an adjustment period sometimes, and this can range from up to an hour to maybe a session, maybe two, depends on the person. But everyone, everyone I've played with, eventually gets immersed into the story <i>while</i> continuing to hit the system. And <i>most</i> of the people I've story gamed with came at it either from a traditional "deep immersion" stance or from chat room and LJ roleplaying where "deep immersion" holds a similar pedastal position to "good roleplaying." I know its a false dichotomy.<br/><br/>That's not to say there aren't preferences. For a variety of reasons people might prefer the traditional systems, including the way you get immersed (getting deep into character by shutting out the rules and/or authorship instead of getting deep into character by integration of the rules and/or authorship). But in my experience, and I want to be clear on this, I've never had someone be <i>unable</i> to get immersed, even if they ended up prefering a different method. At most they needed two sessions instead of, say, an hour, but eventually it clicked, always. So, the idea that a story game and immersion don't go together is bullshit. Some of it is people taking their preference as a gospel truth, as is quite common on the internet, and most are simply going with the gut instinctual response based on their preconcieved assumptions without even trying.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134921/#Comment_134921" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T12:49:30+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 12:49PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Player-as-consumer is essentially treating gaming the same way, except there is no reciprocity.

How is playing -- and by this, I mean engaging with the game, having fun, helping people around you have fun -- <i>not</i> giving anything back to the game?  Are you assuming that someone who isn't acting as an Author in the full story games sense just sitting there on his chair drooling slightly, saying nothing and just picking up and rolling dice every few minutes?  Because, and I hope you'll pardon me for saying so, that's just a shitty player: it has absolutely fuck-all to do with immersiveness or preferences in Authorial-vs-Character stance or whatever, it's just some jerk being a dead weight.<br/><br/>Playing in a game IS a way of giving back to the game; there are so many opportunities for a "pure player" to contribute to the experience and improve everyone's fun -- including and especially the GM's fun -- that I'm not sure where this is even coming from.  Not everybody has to have, share, or use narrative authority to be a productive, proactive, kickass part of a game.

But in reality, you are 5' hight with glasses and a lisp. You NEED the help of the other player, every one of them, to maintain the "illusion" when you play-act: they all need to "be conscious of the story", at the author-level, enough to remember acting scared when you talk to them.<br><br>Also: to really play your character, you need somebody for him to interact.  Say that you play someone really scared of women. You NEED someone to play a woman for you to show his fear, or that will never enter in the game, and your character will only exist in your head. Often this is the GM's work, but (1) he need help in this - the other players has to be conscious of your needs, or they will never go somewhere where the GM can play a woman, for example, and (2) you must TELL SOMEBODY about this, tell in some way to the other player what you need to be able to "live" your character. You must think as an author at least a little before the game, if not during it. But really deep-immersive players often dislike even this bit of "authoring".<br><br>(So they are often frustrated, and it's really only their own fault, not the system's, but I digress...) <br/><br/>I think it's for this reason that many people dislike having this kind of deep-immersive players in the group: they are high-maintenance, the GM has to guess what they want from the game, the other players have to guess to, and they don't tell it. It's a lot of work, guessing what he/she could enjoy, and having to fight against his desire to "don't tell you, or it will ruin he/her fun"<br/><br/>I have seen it work when there is only one of these players at that table, or two at most, and they are well-liked enough by the others that they will gladly make all the work required to make them enjoy the game. But every one of these players is a player that will NOT make that work for other, because "It will ruin his fun", so if there are too many of them at the table, they will be frustrated because "the other players" (who play exactly like them) "don't play in a way that allow he/she to express her character"<br/><br/>There is obviously a functional version of this: the player that can immerse when he want to enjoy his immersion, but know how to get "out of character" when he need to, to talk with the gm and the other players about what they want from the game, or has learned to use the system to show them what he want (keys in TSOY, kickers, the choice of fallout in DitV, the "Issue" in PTA, etc.). This kind of player usually doesn't have any problem in playing story-games (in general: he could have problems with the ones that require being ALWAYS in a director's stance, like Universalis  for example) because many of these usually separate the instances of authoring power from the play-acting.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134937/#Comment_134937" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T13:38:26+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  1:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 1:39PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Cross-posted with Moreno)<br/><br/>See, I wonder if the whole "immersion/story dichotomy" thing is really a product of character immersion simply being taken too far. Anything can be done to extremes, and extreme behavior is the quickest way to mess up a group's social contract. I see the discussion as being muddled because some folks who claim to be immersive can still obviously regulate the tendency so they can function socially in their groups, or their groups are such that they don't have to self-regulate. Others clearly can't do this, or won't do this, or there's a large clash of expectations.<br/><br/>For myself, I've encountered the dichotomy mostly as having everything to do with status relationships, and not very much to do with anything else. People, by and large, do not want bad shit to happen to them. This extends to emotional responses that paint them in a bad light, like losing their temper, showing embarrassment, acting involuntarily out of fear, etc.<br/><br/>Stories, however, to be good, require these things to happen to protagonists. They have to get hurt, and they have to fail, they have to be dumb occasionally, and they have to show the bad side of themselves. That is a hallmark of good conflict. A protagonist who just plows through any conflict without consequences is boring, and a protagonist who never succeeds at anything is sort of ridiculous. At some point, the protagonist has to lose status... if only to create an opportunity for them to regain it or surpass their previous status.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when a player in an RPG is fully immersed in character, they reflexively push as hard as they can against any game events that will change their status, and get angry or frustrated as players when it happens anyway as it inevitably must in any story. And I don't mean this in the Big Model Narrativist sense of story, I mean it in the "any series of sequential events that's remotely entertaining from an external POV" sense of story. Sometimes, that backlash can be so disruptive that it effectively halts the game, or turns the whole thing into little more than wish fulfillment, making the GM back off on providing relevant adversity because he doesn't want to create a social problem. <br/><br/>Some mechanics can accelerate this process - I'm looking directly at an instance of SotC play I had where a player flatly told me that he could not make a decision to accept a compel because he couldn't separate his perspective from his character's, and his character would never allow for the complication to happen. SotC is not for him, and I can accept that. To that player's credit, though, he's a good sport when the fall of the dice lowers his status, because well, he can't do anything about that. <br/><br/>But is it really fair to say, even given the above, that the dichotomy is really between story and immersion because of the nature of those two things? Perhaps it's better said that some people can become *so* immersed as to be socially disruptive in some groups... just like some people can become *so* competitive, or some people can become *so* directorial (and yes, I've had PTA games where exactly that has happened). Any behavior, taken to extremes, can fuck up the mojo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134939/#Comment_134939" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T13:42:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  1:42PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DM Lady: "The thief, Black Leaf, did not find the poison trap, and I declare her dead."<br/>\nMarcie: "NO, NOT BLACK LEAF!

It's entirely possible to create new stuff in the game while functioning in the context of your character. The effect is just more subtle. It's also entirely possible to bring out whatever the innermost urges your character has - it's just a lot slower process. <br><br>But:<br/><br/>(Deep) Character immersion is preference that rarely works well along with other preferences. A lone character immersionist in a group is a sad player, soon enough. Likewise, a lone player favoring author stance is going to be really out of his depth in a character immersive group, either being bored to death in matter of minutes, or being chased out of the building for that irritating and endless extrovert chit-chat.<br/><br/>Getting kicks from things going down for your character is something of a matter of being able to separate yourself from the character before and after the event, not during it. <br/><br/>Character immersive players are high-maintenance, but luckily in a group full of them, they maintain themselves.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just adding in my props for what Mike said (waaaay upthread now).<br/><br/>I have one guy in particular I know, great guy and very generous in a game, and the example he'd give is mostly when system-handling intervenes in his "flow". Like, roleplaying an intense conversation with his lover trying to convince her to betray her father, and then the GM says "right, roll Persuasion", and he'd feel "aargh! we were in this awesome flow and now it's gone!" I feel compelled to mention that he'd never complain about this or be a dick about it, but he did lean towards systems that wouldn't intervene in those moments.<br/><br/>For me, it's the authoring level - what I have traditionally thought of as immersion gets busted, personally, when I have to make a decision about how the story should go. And mostly I don't care. When I self-check to make sure the stuff I'm doing with my character isn't going to make the game un-fun for others, that definitely busts my-version-of-immersion, but it's hardly catastrophic.

Perhaps they are, in which case its not a very interesting complaint. My reaction to the claim of selfish play is the following grain of truth, at least for myself: if I play in a non-immersed manner, I am at least slightly more entertaining, flexible, and sensitive to audience considerations when I play deep immersed. When deep immersed, I have a hard time taking into account whether the player across from me has had dinner, what movies he has seen lately, etc. I have a harder time responding to player facial cues of "I'm bored" or "that's awesome, keep doing it." It's practically axiomatic: if I am ignoring player-level, non-character-interpretable, "metagame" stuff, then I can't possibly be adapting to it as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn extreme case: suppose I am a member of an otherwise traditional game, with one GM and several other players. If I play as a "co-GM", with no PC of my own, spending all my effort helping the primary GM set pacing, look up rules, play NPCs, etc. I can do more to help with pacing, fleshing out the setting, fast rule look ups, and so forth then I would be if I were playing - immersed or not. I could very well end up contributing more fun to the other players... at the cost of reducing my own fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is a continuum of focusing my attention on entertaining myself, and focusing my attention on entertaining others. It's hard to hit boundary cases (absolutely zero other entertainment, absolutely zero self-fun) because the act of entertaining others can lead to personal fulfillment, and I can still bring content and material to the table while deep in character immersed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as whether immersiveness are high maintenance, speaking for myself, I disagree and agree. I agree in the sense that it's really hard for me to do certain logistical tasks in the middle of a scene, like looking up rules, requesting scene changes, and so forth. (hence, some systems are better than others) On the other hand, as I have said before, there are certain things I just stop caring about when deeply immersed. I don't care if the story is "Good" or if we have been negotiating with the shopkeeper for the last 3 hours. I don't care if the characters have had real impact on the game world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, one other variable here is pre-game versus during-game work. If you want me to spend a couple hours making up settings, fleshing out characters, reading rules, etc. BEFORE PLAY, then immersion is entirely consistent with that. For example, I HAVE asked new GMs to stop asking me to look up rules during play, while simultaneously offering to discuss and clarify and teach the rules BEFORE play as much as they want. I'm also really terrible about deferring to other players when I am playing a high-status character immersively... so if there is a problem of me taking too much scene time, I'll switch to a low-status character between scenes/sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134963/#Comment_134963" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T15:38:50+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  3:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also say that it is quite possibly to be deeply immersed and capable of attending to the needs of others ... by attending to the needs of their characters.

After 3 games of PTA I still spend 90% of my time in author stance in those games, and just as I start to get into the flow of character, a conflict comes and knocks me right out. "What would you like to have happen, as a player? How many resources (entirely uninterpretable in character) are you willing to spend for that outcome?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played Polaris about 15 times. It's the most conducive game to handling the mechanics intuitively and subconsciously I've seen except for pure "yes, and" freeform or "mother may I" freeform with GM-veto. It has scene breaks where we can get all logistically necessary metagame chatter out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 15 games or so... It's still less conducive than freeform, very simple trad games with an above average GM, or LARP for maintaining deep in character immersion for me. I mean, maybe at some point I'll truly master the system forwards and backwards, but that great day still hasn't come. Maintaining constant character-immersion (within scenes) no problem. Constant deep in character immersion? Maybe every other scene, and "you ask far too much" always knocks me out. Not to mention every scene break necessarily knocks me out of deep IC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135591/#Comment_135591" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T17:38:18+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  5:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2008 5:50PM by woodelf.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite><br>People are claiming it, but from what I've seen and experienced it's a false dicotomy.

At most they needed two sessions instead of, say, an hour, but eventually it clicked, always. So, the idea that a story game and immersion don't go together is bullshit.

And, for the 15+ years i've seen it discussed online, those who both practice it and value it have consistently described/defined it as <i>character</i> immersion, where they are, as much as possible, considering things <i>only</i> through the lens of their character's POV.

What i want out of my RPGs often aligns with the definition of Narrativist goals, but i want to achieve those goals through, well, the narration, not the mechanics. Because the mechanics keep intervening when i "know" what the appropriate result is, thematically/narratively.

Sure, maybe they won't have that Empathic or Channelling sensation that Mike mentions, but there's a different experience that replaces it, which is the story immersion, or perhaps even other flavors depending on the game (tactical immersion? setting immersion? I've had those too.) You get involved with the whole story, and often your character is a focal point of that.  But instead, they hear crap like "you can't get immersed and have authorship" and assume "Oh, then I guess that type of game is not for me" which is a complete and utter bullshit assumption.

I don't think discussion is pointless. At the very least, one can identify which hippie mechanics are terrible and which are merely problematic for deep ic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mechanics dealing with story and setting are so totally intuitive and internalized that they can be handled completely subconsciously, then they should be consistent with deep character immersion (As I defined above, you handle character subconsciously, and you aren't thinking about anything uninterpretable by the character on a conscious level). Examples for me include very simple norms ("never mention rape during this game!" can be handled subconsciously) and sometimes application of Polaris (ritualized applications of "but only if..."). Furthermore, being able to manipulate the setting subconsciously is in some sense essential to deep character immersion in tabletop. For example, it's very important, arguably essential to be able to translate vague descriptions of setting given by other players into a visualization of the imaginary world automatically, reflexively. It's been discussed elsewhere that mastery of system (being able to subconsciously manipulate system elements) is useful for the deep part of deep IC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I am starting to think that re-writing the character on the fly (analogue to author stance), even subconsciously, might cause problems, while rewriting the setting on the fly (analogue to director stance) subconsciously is much easier, even necessary (i.e. interpreting setting descriptions above). For example, I think every time I nudge my character away from doing certain things because of a taboo, my connection suffers even if I am not fully aware of the nudging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135649/#Comment_135649" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T07:48:46+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  7:48AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2008 7:49AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While my own personal bias is to note that I've had fun with both methods of play, and wonder why others don't, I don't question their preference.

To quote from <i>GNS and Other Matters of Role-Playing Theory</i>: "Narrativism is expressed by the creation, via role-playing, of a story with a recognizable theme. The characters are formal protagonists in the classic Lit 101 sense, and the players are often considered co-authors. The listed elements provide the material for narrative conflict (again, in the specialized sense of literary analysis)." So, if i tell you the story about this one time i went to the video store, and there is no theme in it (it's just a rambling narrative with no real point--and no real beginning or end, and no conflict, for that matter), it is not a "narrative" in the sense that the Big Model is referring to. <br/><br/>Now, personally, i sometimes enjoy stories--both as a reader, and as a RPer--without conflict. But only rarely. I frequently, however, enjoy stories that have no theme, no real beginning/middle/end structure, etc. Stuff that Lit101 might tell you is either "a poor narrative" or "not a narrative [worth considering]", depending on who you're talking to. [Maybe. My limited exposure to formal literary theory leads me to question the validity of that definition (the "about a theme" part) even in the context of litcrit. The few people i know with more litcrit background than i tend to agree with me. But that's neither here nor there--whether the definition of Narrativism has a valid basis in litcrit doesn't matter, so long as we're all on teh same page when we discuss it.] I also rather like my theme to emerge organically and unintentionally, rather than have a story deliberately stake out a theme and try to express/explore it. <br/><br/>That last isn't necessarily inherently in conflict with Narrativist-oriented RPing, but it does seem to be in conflict with most Narrativist-encouraging RPGs that i've gotten a chance to read (or play). In large part because most of them embody the theme stuff in the mechanics, making it front-and-center whether you like it or not. I'm a 'not'. Even when i want a theme to be the center of my RPG experience, i've so far preferred it to have nothing to do with the mechanics. Which isn't to say that some RPG won't do it in such a way that i love it--just that i haven't found that game yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135666/#Comment_135666" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T09:03:31+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  9:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a BM authority, by any means, but I think you are mixing together 'narrative' and 'narrativism'. There is no special definition of 'narrative' in relation to BM, other than the normal: a story. And as it has been said many time, any roleplaying session no matter what agenda, preferences or whatever in the end produces a story. It doesn't say anything about whether it was a meaningful story, a good story, a boring story, a story with no or lots of conflict, or a story that the participants enjoyed or hated.<br/><br/>You may not like to collaboratively create meaning/theme from a given premise in a game and have the game's mechanics support that process. That's totally cool, it's not your preference. But it doesn't narrow down a definition of what 'narrative' is - I don't see why you would draw that conclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_135673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135673/#Comment_135673" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T09:31:02+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  9:31AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite> In the end we're talking about play preferences, and to each their own.</blockquote>I second that!<br/><br/>My primary goal is to immerse in the character.

The most pernicious moment this occurs, in our experience, is the old "we've just had this awesome dialogue, now let the dice decide what really happens" thing. Depending on the system, it may also crop up when stakes discussions start.<br/><br/>IMO it's the self-awareness of the story that is mutually exclusive with deep in-character play. I'm not self-aware of the story of my own life as I'm living it. When my players want to be deeply immersed, they want to live their characters' life, and that requires immediacy. Story-awareness, practically by definition, requires a removal from immediacy and urgency to consider the larger themes at play. "What my character would do," "What I would do," and "What would make the best story" are often perceived as mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>Now...I suppose it's entirely possible to live one's life in the Real World with a strong sense of one's own story. Actually, I sort of remember having that mindset for a few months or years when I was in my teens -- I wanted to live a life of meaning and drama. I don't feel that much, any more, since I've got a stronger sense that "a good story" = flawed characters overcoming strife, and I neither <i>want</i> to be flawed nor overcome self-imposed strife.<br/><br/>So, for me, squaring up that story self-awareness and that deeply in-character headspace means returning to a juvenile period of my own development, which isn't actually something that interests me.<br/><br/>All these months and years of immersion talk/argument have gotten me thinking really hard about what goes into a game that's strongly focused on a purely immersive tabletop experience, and where that can shine in contrast to the VR computer-mediated concept.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135775/#Comment_135775" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T23:25:00+00:00" title="March 20, 2008 11:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of these days I'm going to harvest a whole bunch of statements "My personal version of Immersion involves..." and get people to rate them 1 (true) - 5 (not true) and then factor analysis that son of a bitch.<br/><br/>We are long past needing some stastical analysis in the house.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136048/#Comment_136048" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T14:30:36+00:00" title="March 23, 2008  2:30PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2008 2:31PM by Per_Fischer.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Nat,<br/><br/>I couldn't find a dedicated BM definition of "story" or "narrative", but if you count the essays as part of the BM complex, here's what the nar essay says:<br/>"Story structure<br/>Classically, a story has the following structure: (a) introduce character and situation, (b) introduce conflict, (c) rising conflict, (d) climax, and (e) resolution, of which (a, b, d) are the key pieces. Most stories indeed follow this model regardless of their chronological presentation, point-of-view, or any other details. There's usually no particular worry that Narrativist play will fail to produce a story (of whatever quality), without any overt effort to force it."<br/><br/>I don't find that narrows down what a story is.<br/><br/>I searched for what I remember as Ron stating most RPG sessions produce some kind of story, but I couldn't - so maybe I'm mistaken in fact. In fact the essay says: "A transcript may or may not be a story." Maybe I got that mixed together in my head <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think what I meant was this quote from the same essay:<br/>"The real question: after reading the transcript and recognizing it as a story, what can be said about the Creative Agenda that was involved during the role-playing? The answer is, absolutely nothing. We don't know whether people played it Gamist, Simulationist, or Narrativist, or any combination of the three. A story can be produced through any Creative Agenda. The mere presence of story as the product of role-playing is not a GNS-based issue."<br/><br/>Hmm, this was supposed to be a whisper to Nat - apologies, guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6022/immersion-versus-story" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6022/immersion-versus-story" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6022/immersion-versus-story/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6022%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6022%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
