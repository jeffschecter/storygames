Dave Arneson played in Braunstein (iirc) and another game set in a Banana Republic run by a guy named Mjr Weseley(sp? and no, I never remember the guy's proper first name).<br/><br/>Anyway, the original designer/ref ended up being called off for service, and Dave picked up the idea and started running a fantasy version which (again, iirc) became Blackmoor, and eventually evolved into D&amp;D. As I was very young at the time, I wasn't there for any of this, and have picked up the story many persons removed.<br/><br/>Other folks will have nifty links about th game, and a couple of folks got to play in a replay of the game last year or so at a convention.<br/><br/>So, basically, I'd like to see what folks around this joint would come up with to do something similar, especially being familiar with all sorts of dirty-hippy mechanics and techniques for gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201640/#Comment_201640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T19:36:01+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  7:36PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

Not sure how a workshop would work differently than a contest, except perhaps even more open for the purposes of sharing info and ideas back and forth, perhaps? The goal being not so much to have a winner but to get multiple complete projects?<br/><br/>As for what a Braunstein would be, I don't think minis are necessary, although I'd certainly use them in play because I like them. I do think that some sort of central artifact table ( maps, whatever) adds flair. The big things to me are that there is some sort of central scenario, with preloaded conflicts and characters, and that the designer is also the ref. Um, personally, I'd say that a ref is exactly what the designer is; that is he or she isn't there to put a whole lot of stuff into action story or events wise, but to mediate the action as it occurs.<br/><br/>I'd think there'd also be multiple conflicting goals for each character or faction, with the ref only having a limited set of mechanical aids to work with, and a nexpectation that the players would come up with stuff the ref would have to deal with mechanically on the fly.<br/><br/>Now, OTOH, a GM-less Braunstein, that would be _hot_!<br/><br/>Perhaps a list of seemingly classic "Braunstein elements"? Or two lists, Chinese Menu style ( "Must have at least one from column A and two or more from Column B")? I do think that a Braunstein should inherently be seen as a one-shot "event" game, personally, which might alter people's design thinking as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201666/#Comment_201666" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-12T07:17:55+00:00" title="April 12, 2009  7:17AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have thought the historical scenario as well as the scoring would also weight heavy in their with the preloaded conflicts and characters.

The scoring would have occured to me, but I wouldn't have thought so much about the historical part. I've been assuming that the historical setting of B-stein and the Banana Republic games were mostly a result of the players and designer being historical gaming buffs and using what was available to them. IIRC, there wasn't much in the way of fantasy or SF gaming minis in existence at the time.<br/><br/>Certainly, neither seems especially severely historical; more like "inspired by history" ( in the Hollywood sense) than an attempt to recreate it.<br/><br/>Again though, I'm not an expert by any means, this being all my own take on what I've heard. If there were to be a list of Common Braunstein elements to choose from, and you felt strongly about the inclusion of the historical re-enactment bend, I think it should be on the list as that may well be something other folks are pulled to/inspired by that I'm not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201723/#Comment_201723" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-12T21:49:28+00:00" title="April 12, 2009  9:49PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2009 9:54PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...right, what goes a into a contest, then?*<br/><br/>Roughly, I suppose we need judges, contestants, a completion deadline, and some restrictions.<br/><br/>Who is up for which parts?<br/><br/><br/>*In answer to a whispered challenge!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201762/#Comment_201762" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T07:31:02+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  7:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, for a workshop (as opposed to a contest) we need... exactly the same.

I do want to strike while the iron is hot. <br/><br/>How about something in stages. I think I could cobble together enough info/creative restrictions by this coming Saturday to get it kicked off. <br/><br/>My suggestion would then be for a week of co-operative brainstorming, with particpants simply naming an initial project and brief description, and each person helping the others hash out their vision of the project. Then at least a week or two out into the wilderness as each planner goes off to work a bit on their own.<br/><br/>Then a remeet and discussion week to smooth things out and have a very rough version.<br/><br/>On the upside, if I understand the original Braunstien and Banana Republic games correctly, this is about how far that Mjr Weseley took his designs before presenting them for play. I've yet to see anything that could be called a rulebook exactly, instead existing mostly as notes ans cheatsheets and order sheets for the players.<br/><br/>After that? Hmm. Perhaps helping one another get local Actual Plays organized and a report-back on that? A general review and assessment of how things went, and how the game might be written up to be more transferable to people not at the original playing of the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201822/#Comment_201822" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T13:06:46+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  1:06PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the contest idea.<br/><br/>Historically, how are characters defined in Braunstein?

I'd like opinions/feedback:<br/>What the heck is a \u201cBraunstein\u201d? <br/><br/>Braunstein was a one-off, multi-player, refereed miniatures game designed by Dave (\u201cMajor\u201d) Wesely waaay back in the day (1967). The setting was a fictional town named Braunstein during the Napoleonic Wars. Wesely later went on to create and present similar games, including one set in a fictional Central America country (\u201cThe Banana Republic game\u201d). Significantly, one of the participants in these games was Dave Arneson, the creator of the Blackmoor Campaign and co-creator (with Gary Gygax) of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. In a very real way, Arneson\u2019s experiences with \u201cBraunsteins\u201d (we\u2019ve simply given the style of game the name of the original) led to the creation of D&amp;D and later role-playing games.<br/><br/>Style elements of Braunsteins<br/><br/>While I\u2019d hardly call myself a scholar on the subject, a few things strike me as being significant about Braunsteins. Participants in the contest should consider which of these elements they\u2019ll use (or modify) in their own projects.<br/><br/>Multiple players<br/>Braunstein was designed as a multi-player game, with each player taking on the role of an individual character or faction leader. Each character or faction would have their own goals, and even apparent allies might end up at cross-purposes, while apparent enemies might find some common ground to work together on.<br/><br/>Neutral Referee<br/>The designer of the scenario is also likely to be the referee. Neutrality is important in this regard. Further, the referee is expected to make up rules or methods to cover situations not inherent in the rules, as the players are empowered to attempt any sort of actions their characters or factions should be able to attempt within the context of the scenario. It\u2019s also worth considering exactly what responsibilities and capabilities you wish the referee to have within the game. Off-hand, outside of possibly some pre-planned events, the referee really won\u2019t be engaging in the central creative role, fiction-wise, as a GM in more traditional role-playing games. The referee here is more of a facilitator and mediator than a truly active participant.<br/><br/>One-Shot<br/>A Braunstein is generally conceived as a one-shot game, to be played in an environment not unlike a gaming convention or a single evening meet-up at a club or game-shop. To that end, the designer will be working under time constraints, both for total play-time and for teaching time for players. On the other hand, unlike a game meant to be printed up and distributed, the designer can be a good bit looser with the write ups, perhaps getting away with mere notes for himself, and cheat sheets for the players.<br/><br/>Scenario-based with pre-generated characters and pre-loaded conflicts<br/>In general, players will interpret the characters they receive, rather than create their own from scratch. Likewise, characters should start within a web of conflicts. By design, this should put the point of the action squarely on the player-characters, rather than outside events or GM characters.<br/><br/>The table, maps, minis, and other physical stuff<br/>Braunsteins were originally made to be used with miniatures and/or maps, necessitating the use of a table. At the same time, the nature of the conflicts in a multiplayer game almost inherently suggests the need for players to separate and go conspire throughout the course of play. Designers should consider this and take it into account in their project.<br/>I would recommend, at minimum, looking at the classic game, Diplomacy, to see how that game works with a similar game-play situation.<br/><br/>Strictly speaking, the use of minis and maps is likely a cultural artifact due to the original players being minis gamers. Participants in this contest, however, should consider what possible benefits they could derive from having a table set-up, beyond just a nod to tradition. At minimum, it provides a physical central meeting point.<br/><br/>Likewise, while the original Braunstein was a sort of modified minis wargame, there is no particular reason to restrict conflicts to a merely single physical conflict occurring continuously over a short period of time, the way one finds in minis wargames. Time can be broken up by \u201cscenes\u201d or similar pacing devices, for example, and the draw of the early Braunstein and Banana Republic games seems to have ended up centering on character actions outside of direct battlefield domination.<br/><br/>Setting<br/>Someone noted that the original Braunstein was a historical setting, and felt that this was an important element of the design of similar games. I personally tend to feel that this, as with the use of historical minis as a core element, is mostly an indication of the gaming roots of the designers and players. Having said that, I would suggest that an easily -grasped situation and setting are almost a must, given the one-shot nature, the multi-player competition, and time-constraints of a Braunstein.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202131/#Comment_202131" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T09:43:24+00:00" title="April 15, 2009  9:43AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued due to length)<br/><br/>Going of the tracks, coloring outside the lines, and role-playing as a tactic<br/>In these predecessors to RPGs, role-playing appears to have been a tactic to be used in an attempt to win the game. By that, I mean that characterization (as well as attempting character actions not covered by any core rules) was seen as a means of outwitting the other players, or at least getting them to be more compliant with your own schemes. How a participant in this contest works that into their design is up to them. Dave Arneson was apparently quite the character (no pun intended) in the banana republic game, leading to him being declared the winner. A large part of that success was apparently due to going almost entirely outside of the rules-structure to accomplish his goals.<br/><br/>Winners and losers<br/>Braunstein and its successors were meant to be played competitively, and that competition was meant to be between the players, not between the referee and the players. Designers should consider how they will decide the winner or winners of their game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202144/#Comment_202144" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T10:49:18+00:00" title="April 15, 2009 10:49AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it sounds like, in the end, a high-discretion GM-run game where the players are situated with a mix of compatible and incompatible goals and the GM is explicitly neutral.

Refinement, in terms of layout, artwork, and presentation is appreciated, but not a primary requirement. After all, Dave Arneson was apparently known for bringing early drafts of the D&amp;D rules to sessions scribbled on whatever scrap paper was near at hand.<br/><br/>Current working time is estimated at two weeks.<br/><br/>Team design: While each participant is considered to be the primary author for purposes of determining a winner, participants are allowed to recruit any additional aid from anyone they choose, including other participants working on their own scenarios. Teamwork, and a general workshop approach, is encouraged.<br/><br/>Judging a winner:<br/>Winner will be determined by secret vote, held one week after the deadline for presenting projects. Voting will be restricted to participants, including those recruited to aid in design (so put them in the credits) even if they did not head up a design. Designers may not vote for their own design. Participants who did not lead a design effort may not vote for a design they worked on. Voting will last for 48 hours, then tallied and announced. <br/><br/>Exact deadlines to be announced when the official contest thread is posted.<br/><br/>What to judge a design on:<br/>How close does the design stick to general elements of Braunsteins?<br/>Has the author consciously addressed elements in a new or novel fashion?<br/>Has the author provided enough information for someone other than themselves to run this game, provided any physically required components were present?<br/><br/>Provided that enough projects are presented in a relatively complete form, I suggest we follow-up with actual play-tests soon after the end of the contest. I personally would score a design higher if the author and team are able to get a play-test and refinement in before the end of the contest.<br/><br/>_____<br/><br/>Thoughts? Anything I could refine or clarify?

There's clearly a bunch of borrowing from one b-stein design to the next, but I don't think you really need to create any overacrching or universal system, at least not out of the gate. In that regard, yes, they are a bit like murder party games.<br/><br/>For myself, I'm going to use pretty exceedingly simple resolution mechanics, on par with Engle Matrix Games, and spend my time concentrating on the scenario characters and situation, perhaps with a side foray into scene and pacing mechanics and the Ref's role in that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202187/#Comment_202187" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T14:27:09+00:00" title="April 15, 2009  2:27PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rules are fine with me.

I've edited it slightly so as not to offend the delicate ears of SG readership:<br/><br/>My thinking:<br/><br/>One way to go is to just program out a really complicated "situation" in the style of the original Braunstein. Here's a bunch of characters, here's your backgrounds, here's your to-do items, now go. It appears the players have simply no rules AT ALL, they just start saying what they want to do. The ref then times out arrivals and movement according to what's cool and what puts people in maximum contact for maximum fireworks. I don't see a lot of guidance for the ref -- and why would there be? The ref knows "how" to run his own game! This one seems tough, insofar as you're basically setting up an unresolved opening to a novel, or perhaps just running a CENSORED Jeepform game at that point. CENSOR that noise. CENSORing Jeeps. :-(<br/><br/>Another way to go is to totally deconstruct and reconstruct the Braunstein experience, using modern design thinking to hand a lot of mechanical control over to the players while maintaining the cool shit that comes from being the ref (a creative director holding everything together, impartial judgement). I think you could build some mechanically interesting ways to either mandate impartiality, or to give the GM a set of motives that are perpendicular to the players' efforts. That's something I was thinking about today: The players have their to-do list and a list of assets and liabilities (belong to X faction, friends to Y, enemies of Z) and they're earning VPs, maybe, for working their way through their hit list. But then the GM is also earning VPs, but for totally different stuff -- each time a player uses an asset, each time a player achieves a goal, and so on. So the GM's motives for ruling one way or another aren't related to the players' motives. This might also introduce some replayability, in that people could "compete" for the most reffing VPs.<br/><br/>I'm not feeling a strong sense of how to profitably leverage the natural social tension between players who all want what they want, and the effort of the ref to remain truly impartial. Like in sports, the ref needs to remain above the players' agenda. I'm not sure it's fun or healthy to try and dick with that; it turns into D&amp;D Diplomacy at that point, right?<br/><br/>A third way I was thinking about, which I hinted at earlier, was a meta-Braunstein engine. Like...you'd have Oracle-like lists of place, factions, and goals. The players would get a budget with which to buy those things, with a minimum of one each (so you could have more places, or goals, or whatever). Goals earn you VPs but places and factions earn you in-game benefits. And maybe everyone blind-draws a name from a hat, and that name (another player) is now "your enemy." So you get some benefit when working against them. I dunno. Just kind of riffing here.<br/><br/>I was noodling a bit on ref-less Braunstein and I just don't know how to get there while maintaining the cool "ref handles all the details" vibe I'm getting from the stuff I'm reading.<br/><br/>And that's as far as the beers + shot is going to let me think before sending me off into bullshit-land.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202325/#Comment_202325" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T14:41:50+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  2:41PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My phylosophical understating of <i>real </i>old school D&amp;D, among other things, leads me to think that a Braunstein referee - like the D&amp;D DM which originate from it - is actually two distinct "roles" combined into one person:<br/><br/>- first comes an "author" role, that is, authoring the starting situation;<br/><br/>- then is the actual "referee" role, where the referee is supposed to be not a man, but a function, a machine; except that human beings are smarter than computers.<br/><br/>This is a reply to some of Paul's points, obviously, and especially his calling the referee a "creative director".

So do you think it's easy enough to just say -- "Okay, creator, once you've wound up your toy and set it loose, you don't get to touch it again. Now all you can do is ref the people who will now interact with your toy."<br/><br/>My gut says that the creator will continue having an investment in his setup, but I may be wrong about that. This gets back to the reason it's so cool to get players to participate in world/situation-building, right? The fact you "made" it gives you ownership. So how do you divorce the creative director from the ref? <br/><br/>One solution might be to let the players collaboratively create the situation, but that undermines the core competitiveness of the Braunstein form as I understand it. Then again, if the players were divorced from their characters (in good Burning Wheel-style fashion), it *should* not matter: we collaborate on how to aim the characters into each other just like we collaborate on the setting details.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202464/#Comment_202464" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-17T10:13:07+00:00" title="April 17, 2009 10:13AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more weird thought I'm gonna throw out there:<br/><br/>Okay, so the old Braunsteins were basically refereed proto-RPGs overlaying a core wargame engine, right? <br/><br/>So what would it look like to invert that model?

The attack modes might be "intimidate," "collaborate," "confide" and so on. I really feel like this part needs to be on the simple side, with suitably non-nuanced outcomes -- social equivalents of "damaged" (worked toward a social goal), "killed" (achieve a social goal), "pinned" (keep a character from moving out of an area), "forced retreat" (push a character into an adjacent map area) and so on.<br/><br/>I'm really curious what a Braunstein-colored referee moment looks like, actually, since I'd like to move the physical stuff over to the referee's discretion.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202691/#Comment_202691" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T17:01:21+00:00" title="April 19, 2009  5:01PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I'm really curious what a Braunstein-colored referee moment looks like, actually, since I'd like to move the physical stuff over to the referee's discretion.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not sure what you're talking about here.

Can you give me an example? And what criteria did he use?<br/><br/>I can't tell from just reading the materials, but it looks like the game was set up so that all conflicts were player-driven and player-managed. If it came down to a social thing (convince so-and-so to enter a duel with me), that was on the players to work out using their own real-world social skills. So basically, social conflicts were resolved between players. Actual fighty conflicts I assume were resolved using the basic wargame rules. So what did that leave the referee to do?<br/><br/>My suspicion, again just guessing here, is that the ref was there to decide on things that reframed any given conflict in a non-social, non-combat way. I can't convince this player to let my character and his character enter a duel, so I'm going to...tie up his character! Or: We can't kill all the zombies coming to town so...let's did a trench, fill it with gasoline, and light it up! <br/><br/>Is that about right?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202695/#Comment_202695" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T17:30:21+00:00" title="April 19, 2009  5:30PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's my impression, yes.

After some bad breaks and being on the run, they\u2019ve come to a small, unnamed Mexican village in search of a hoard of gold rumored to be hidden in a strange looking abandoned monastery overlooking the settlement. The bandits have to work fast, as a vicious Mexican army major and his men are hot on their trail. The bandits are confident in their ability to push the peasants of the village around to do their dirty work, but they are missing two important bits of information. First, the villagers are lead by a tough-as-nails old priest and protected by a band of former soldaderas, well-seasoned from protecting themselves from the depredations of various bands of soldiers and bandits during the worst days of the Mexican Civil War. Second, the monastery was built to house the immortal remains of none other than the legendary vampire lord, Dracula, who has only recently awakened and is growing more powerful night by night.<br/><br/>Where this came from:<br/>An urge to use a bunch of miniatures that I bought but have never actually gamed with.<br/>Inspiration drawn  from a number of strange looking, cheap Mexican films I see every now and then at video store clearances that seem to pack all kinds of unlikely stuff into one film, kitchen-sink style, Unfortunately, I own no luchador miniatures or they\u2019d most certainly be in there, too.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Physical stuff I\u2019ve got already in various forms of completion:</span><br/>8 banditos in red jackets<br/>A big wonkin\u2019 Dracula\u2019s castle model<br/>A priest armed with a shotgun and a crucifix<br/>5 armed up soldaderas<br/>Dracula, his brides, four wolf-men, four nosferatu, and six child vampires<br/>Six scratch built adobe buildings, meant for Space 1889 Mars, but they\u2019ll work okay<br/>A sandy colored sheet of cloth, some Wile E Coyote type hills, cactuses, etc<br/>A couple dozen MCW Mexican Army troops, partially painted<br/><br/>Things I could still use:<br/>Possibly a few more buildings and village stuff, easily cobbled together<br/>Mexican peasants, but I know where to order these from<br/><br/>Spare stuff:<br/>A variety of Old West minis, various Pulp, Colonial, and VSF minis,  in case British or German spies are needed or some wild Yaqui Indians show up ( well, okay, Apaches, but, whatever-cheap cinema, remember?)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I\u2019m looking at:</span><br/>The game takes place over the course of three days and nights, starting on Friday Morning. By Sunday night, there should be a big showdown. Monday morning should see any sort of wrap up for the survivors.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rules-wise:</span>I\u2019m not too worried about resolution mechanics in themselves. I\u2019m totally comfortable just using some Chris Engle style matrix game stuff for that.<br/><br/>I might, however, have some sort of depleting dice mechanic. Right now, I\u2019m thinking about handing each player a bowl filled with d6s, d8s, d10s, and d12s (each one would have the same numbers of each). As players come into conflict and have roll-offs, the dice go away. I\u2019d probably simply have them use some kind of competing stakes, with the ref acting as facilitator. I\u2019m not sure if the Ref should have any dice at all, or just a bowl like everyone else.<br/><br/>Where I am concerned is working out some details for exactly what the Ref\u2019s job is, particularly as it regards making sure everyone has a turn, regularly. My initial thought is that the Ref gets some kind of quick note about what the player characters bands are up to each day on note cards from the players. The ref then puts those cards in an order that makes sense to him, perhaps placing some connecting scenes or events in between them (if I decide to allow that).<br/><br/>So, a bit like preliminary scene-framing, kinda sorta, if you look at it squinty. Competing players can participate in the scenes being played as well, either as their own character or as temporary characters in the scene. I guess they should be allowed to throw dice if they start a conflict as well, even if they personallly don't have a character present. Again, the ref is there to facillitate the whole thing, perhaps clarifying outcomes before dice hit the table, and collecting up used dice.<br/><br/>I also don\u2019t have any sort of Turn=X amount of Time preset. I\u2019m trying to figure out how I can repurpose Dave Berg\u2019s Pacing Arc chart for this, especially since this is a Braunstein and meant to have the players competing.<br/><br/>Finally, I\u2019d like to work things out somehow so that no actual player can be knocked out of the game before the end, even if their entire little group of minis-characters are all horribly dead.<br/><br/>And I\u2019m shooting for playing the whole thing in 4 hours.<br/>_______________________________________________________<br/><br/>So that\u2019s where I\u2019m at.

I'll have more comments for you later.  For now, here's where I'm at:<br/><br/>My Tax Protest Braunstein<br/><br/>Inspiration: The Ed and Elaine Brown story, Hunter S. Thompson, Montsegur 1244, Storm Over Arnhem, Chainmail.<br/><br/>Scenario Synopsis:<br/><br/>The setting is Arnemoor - an anachronistic medieval/renaissance D&amp;D-style fantasy town.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the merchants of Arnemoor have found themselves very rich - probably having to do with the uptick in trade ever since the town became a staging area for adventurers trying to plumb the depths of the nearby Dungeon of Madness and Doom.  But the lord of the land - Count Harold - has been going through some tough times (trying to pay for crusades to multiple far-off places will do that) and has decided to raise taxes.  The merchants go along at first, but after Count Harold's men come back to double-dip, they decide they've had enough.  They hire a group of adventurers to keep Count Harold's men out of their town.  The adventurers get the town ready Seven Samurai-style and prepare for a siege!<br/><br/>The Player Factions:<br/><br/>The Revolting Merchants, Count Harold's Men, the Adventurers.<br/><br/>There are also "neutral", non-player factions: the Townsfolk, other random adventurers, and (possibly) the monsters of the Dungeon of Doom and Madness.<br/><br/>The Merchants have money and planning on their side.  They saw this coming and are ready for the fight/seige.  But they're reliant on the Adventurers for protection.  Their real power is tied up in the connections they have with other merchants outside of the County.<br/><br/>Count Harold's faction has access to lots of men, but they are low quality.  They're also underfunded and probably less well fed than the people in the town, despite the seige.  They have a man inside the town - the Sheriff - but he has to constantly watch his back, because everyone knows he's the Count's man.<br/><br/>The Adventurers see this as a way to make some money in a much less arbitrarily dangerous way than dungeon delving.  <br/><br/>Where I have to go from here:<br/><br/>I'd like to draw up a Storm Over Arnhem-style area map to represent the town and its environs.<br/><br/>I need to draw up specific characters, with specific goals.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of using the basic Engle Matrix rules for resolution, etc.  But I'd also like to jam some bits of Chainmail in to deal with any combat that might occur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203321/#Comment_203321" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T13:51:28+00:00" title="April 23, 2009  1:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2009 1:58PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that a lot, Jon.

Are there any concerns for you about minis combat taking up too much game time?<br/><br/>That was certainly one of my concerns, which is why I was looking at some Stake vs. Stake/Crossed with CEMG style resolution, with Dave Berg's Pacing Chart thrown in as an aid.<br/><br/>Also, I haven't seen the Arnhem board. Is it area based, as opposed to hex based, or something else entirely?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203327/#Comment_203327" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T15:13:44+00:00" title="April 23, 2009  3:13PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, sorry, are we just posting our Braunsteins in this thread, now?

I could see that working really well.<br/><br/>I think Chris Engle has done something similar with some of his actual Matrix Games that he sells. If I remember right, he's pretty fast and loose with the map use.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>Fast'n'loose map use<br/>My impression of CE's map use is that he pretty much let's the players move their pieces ( characters, troops, whatever) anywhere on the map they wish, unless there is some sort of in-fiction reason they shouldn't be able to easily do so.<br/><br/>I personally would even go a bit more story-game-y with that idea, and say that a player could move their stuff around freely unless there was both an in-fiction reason <b>and</b> another player ( including perhaps the ref) who was willing to contest the thing with some sort of dice roll-off that involved an alternative outcome/stakes. (Right now, the thing I'm working on has dice as a depleting resource when used in a roll-off, so it might matter even more in that design).<br/><br/>So, for example in Jon's game, there might be merchants moving into an area locked down by government troops. It's pretty easy to see how there could be an obstacle to movement. Still, it would require some other player to be willing to actually make an issue out of it and go to a roll-off for that to impede such movement, and the roll-off wouldn't necessarily be a simple block. There would need to be some sort of alternate outcome involved, with some sort of confrontation ( go to minis combat?) or other event described by an opposing player to bother.<br/><br/>I'd still encourage a bit of role-playing/free description in the case, however. Merchants sneaking in in disguise might suggest something other as an outcome than merchants fast-talking their way past a checkpoint. Either adds to the fiction, but later complications might be different.<br/><br/>Combat and Role-playing:<br/>Jon, my impression is that the role-playing in the original B-steins was at least partly a reaction to general lack of rules and partly due to the deadliness of combat. So, role-playing in that context ( especially with a roughly sketched pregen character) is only partly about development of the character in a "deep" sense. It may well grate on some sensibilities, but it strikes me that "playing one's character" in a way that engages the other players positively is also a survival tactic in-game.<br/><br/>So, if I play up a rotten, villainous character, but the other players are "into it", they may well choose to let the character live, at least for a while, because of the amusement of the actual, real people involved.<br/><br/>The other thing that might encourage role-playing (how ever it's defined) is the shortness of a single event.<br/><br/>Without the freedom of an open-ended campaign to allow, slow, thoughtful character development, players are more likely (IMO) to grab onto something recognizable, maybe even stereotypical/archetypical, and run with that for characterization. They may well also go in a direction they wouldn't in a campaign set-up, just because they can explore options a bit, knowing that they have no commitment to the character or situation beyond this single game session.<br/>Refu ( and everyone else):<br/>When you have time to pop into the thread with an idea about a project, by no means feel you have to have a mostly done project to show off. Hit us with your core concept, in whatever form it takes, then go from there. <br/><br/>I'd like this to be as much about helping one another through rough spots in the design process than anything else.<br/><br/>I'd also encourage folks to remember that thes B-steins were designed with a one-shot play event in mind, so the smoothness and refinement of later, to-be-published-and-distributed-to-strangers, type games is somewhat less important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203763/#Comment_203763" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T20:13:59+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:13PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2009 9:04PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. Kinda quiet 'round here.<br/><br/>I got a bit more done on Maladicion. <br/><i><b>Los Ochos Diablos Rojos de Juarez y La Maladicion de Drakula</b></i> core mechanics<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Free-Play and rules you won\u2019t find in this game</b></span><br/>This game is based around the concept of free-play; Players simply describe what is happening, speak as their character, and move pieces around as appropriate, based upon the info you\u2019ve been given and any in-game precedent that develops during play. When you disagree with another player, you can call for a contest. This means you won\u2019t find character stats, initiative rules, combat results, movement rates, or, frankly, lots of stuff you\u2019re probably used to seeing in games.  <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Contests</b></span><br/><br/>A contest occurs whenever two players disagree on described events, and simple negotiation does not resolve the difference. A player does not need to have a character directly involved in a turn to initiate a contest. To initiate a contest a player simply announces their wish to do so.<br/><br/>The call for a contest must be made in a reasonable amount of time. The referee is authorized to deny a call for a contest if a player is too slow in acting. Generally, the contest should be initiated immediately or at most a few seconds, after events are described.<br/><br/>The player must describe an alternate outcome. Simple blocking of an event is not acceptable grounds for a contest.<br/><br/>The player who has had their description challenged may relent, and modify their description of events using parts of the alternative outcome. <br/><br/>If the player does not relent, or the contesting player does not find the modified events acceptable, a contest occurs. The referee must step in to act as a facilitator, and clarify the terms of the contest. The referee may announce either player\u2019s outcome disproportionate, and demand a different and more equitable outcome.<br/><br/>A contest only ever involves two players. The referee is given full discretion to break down multi-player disagreements into two-player contests.<br/><br/>Each player rolls one their dice. <br/><br/>The high roll wins, and their outcome is added successfully to the fictional events. The winner turns their die over to the referee, while loser retains their die.<br/><br/><b>The special quality of d4s</b><br/>D4s are the only dice that can be added to the result of another die. During a contest, either player may roll a single d4 and add the result to their previous roll. A d4 may be rolled and added after the results of the initial contest roll are seen. If a player adds a d4 roll and wins the contest, they must surrender both dice to the referee.<br/><br/><b>Other Contests</b><br/>He same mechanics described above can be used for essentially any other purpose during the game when two players disagree.<br/><br/>(continues)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203764/#Comment_203764" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T20:14:48+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:14PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2009 9:05PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Dice in the Game</b></span><br/>Dice in the game are a purely meta-game mechanic. They represent nothing more than the individual player\u2019s interest in having their preferred outcome occur during contests. They are also used to determine the winner of the game after the final turn has been played.<br/><br/>Dice are a scarce and depleting resource. This is an intentional part of the game design. Each player begins the game with 12 dice (4 each d6s, d10s, and d12s), while the referee has 24 (8 each d4s, d8s, and d20s) in his bowl. There are 24 turns to a game, and players can individually each roll up to four of their remaining dice during the determination of the Game Winner after the last turn of the game. Needless to say, putting some thought into the dice economy is key element of play.<br/><br/><b>Losing Dice</b><br/>Whenever a player rolls a die in a contest and wins, they must surrender that die to the referee\u2019s bowl of dice. Players keep the die if they lose the contest. <br/><br/>If the referee ever has to roll a die for any reason, that die is immediately and permanently removed from the game, once its result is determined. <br/><br/><b>Gaining Dice</b><br/>Players may gain more dice by achieving objectives, by meeting any special Gain Dice conditions on their faction sheet, or by role-playing villager(s) in a turn where none of their own characters are present. Some objectives can only be determined after the final turn of the game has been played. Players may always attempt to gain an objective die, although the referee has the final say if there is any question regarding whether the objective was attained. Players may hold off claiming an objective die until later in the game if they wish.<br/><br/>When a player gains a die, they get to choose any die from the referee\u2019s bowl.<br/><br/>There are no rules governing players loaning any dice between one another, and players are never required to reveal the remaining number or types of dice in their cup. The referee\u2019s bowl is left openly on the table and can be examined by any player at any time.<br/><br/><b>If a player has no dice</b> <br/>If a player is ever completely out of dice and can prove this to the referee, the referee may loan a die to the player from the referee bowl. The referee chooses the die based on whatever criteria they choose, keeping in mind their neutral role in the game. The die is immediately removed from the game after the roll, just as if the referee had rolled it himself.  The referee may choose to deny a request for a die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203765/#Comment_203765" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T20:15:50+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:15PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2009 9:06PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continues)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Turns</b></span><br/>The game takes place over three days: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each day consists of 8 turns. After 8 turns, the day is over and the story picks up again at dawn of the following day. At the beginning of each day, the referee shuffles and deals out turn cards. Each player receives two turn cards, face down. The turn cards are marked 1-8. Red cards are turns that take place during daylight, black cards at night. Starting from the ace, the player holding the appropriate card flips the card up and starts their turn. Players may not skip a turn.<br/><br/>There are no rules governing trading turn cards, nor are there rules governing players voluntarily revealing turn cards that they have been dealt.<br/><br/>No turn can last more than ten minutes of real time. The referee is required keep watch on time, and gives an appropriate warning if the limit is close to being reached. After ten minutes of play time, the referee is required to end the turn.<br/><br/><br/><b>Playing a turn</b><br/>Each turn is roughly like a key scene in a film or book. When a player has a turn they should provide enough information to get the turn started. That info will include:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location</span><br/>Simply drawing an imaginary line around the boundaries of an area of the board with your index finger is adequate. Key locations tend to be \u201cset\u201d, but space between key locations is \u201cmutable\u201d. This means a player can pick and use spare terrain bits to create further locations as they wish. The space covered can include the entire board.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characters</span><br/>The player must always include at least one of their own characters, and they may freely include characters belonging to other players or villager characters. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timing and Continuity</span><br/>If it takes place at the same time as the previous turn, none of the characters present in that turn may participate in the new turn. The turn may be a direct extension of the previous turn.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Situation</span><br/>The player should announce both general events taking place and give some sort of active goal for at least one of their own characters. They may describe the goals of characters not their own, but this may result in a contest if the owning player disagrees.<br/><br/><br/>When the player is satisfied with the set up, they announce that the turn has started. This initiates a period of free-play. Play continues until the player who started the turn decides to end the turn, or after ten minutes have elapsed. Any contests that occur during the turn also count against the time limit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203766/#Comment_203766" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T20:16:30+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:16PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2009 9:08PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Winning the game</b></span><br/>There are two categories of winners in the game: The game winner and the Players\u2019 Choice Award.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The game winner is determined as follows</span>:<br/>Each player in the game with any surviving characters on the table picks any four dice from their cup, rolls them openly and totals the results. The player with the highest total is declared the winner of the game.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Players\u2019 Choice Award </span><br/>Each player picks one other participant and votes for them as the player who added the most enjoyment to the game. They should be judged on role-playing, sportsmanship, competition, and creativity. The vote is secret, and the ref tallies the votes.<br/><br/>If either contest results in a tie, the referee acts as an instant tie-breaker.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>General hints on winning the game</b></span><br/><b>Dice Control</b><br/>Dice are a depleting resource in this game. Using higher value dice or adding d4s to rolls will allow you to achieve your individual objectives more easily, and thus regain dice.<br/><br/><b>Pacing Control</b><br/>Controlling the pacing of the turns will encourage faster or slower use of dice. It may be to your advantage to end one of your turns quickly or suggest controversial events, depending on whether you wish to retain your dice or deplete those of the referee or other players. If you set up short, easily resolved turns, you will also set yourself up for the ability to gain dice by role-playing villagers. If you set up longer turns, you are more likely to draw out dice from the other players or the referee.<br/><br/><b>Outcome stakes</b><br/>You may choose to relent or even take losses as a result of your particular faction qualities. The other players will not know those details, so use it to best effect.<br/><br/><b>The subjective win</b><br/>The Players\u2019 Choice Award is entirely subjective, so play up characterization and reasonableness of outcomes in contests. Don\u2019t be afraid to \u201cgo off the rails\u201d. A real coup is pulling off a win in both categories, especially with a referee tie-breaker. Remember that players vote for the Players\u2019 Choice Award prior to rolling for game winner.<br/><br/><b>Get big dice</b> <br/>The more large dice you have, the better your score is likely to be at the end of the game. Make sure to balance your dice in cup versus your need to win individual contests.<br/><br/><b>The Game is not balanced</b><br/>Some factions get more dice in-game, some get more after the game ends. Play to your faction.<br/><br/><b>Manipulate the referee and other players</b><br/>It\u2019s dirty and nasty, but a good chunk of this game is about how the other real world human players react to your play-style. There are tons of places where the reaction of the other players will matter, and not just in the Players\u2019 Choice Award. So go on and do it! <br/><br/><b>Be a trouble-maker</b><br/>Feel free to off-handedly mention any number of difficulty inducing possibilities, whether you have characters involved or not.

(Right now, the thing I'm working on has dice as a depleting resource when used in a roll-off, so it might matter even more in that design).<br/><br/>So, for example in Jon's game, there might be merchants moving into an area locked down by government troops. It's pretty easy to see how there could be an obstacle to movement. Still, it would require some other player to be willing to actually make an issue out of it and go to a roll-off for that to impede such movement, and the roll-off wouldn't necessarily be a simple block. There would need to be some sort of alternate outcome involved, with some sort of confrontation ( go to minis combat?) or other event described by an opposing player to bother.</blockquote>\nThat's how I was thinking of using the map.  For the most part, I'd like to handle "unit movement" (as opposed to "character movement") through an Engle Matrix type resolution.  And I agree that a move would have to be contested in order for it to be anything other than an uatomatic success.<br/><br/>My next step is to work through the characters and come up with Goals/Win Conditions.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm thinking that there are 6 main characters: 2 Merchants, 2 Adventurers, 2 Count's Men.  Though each pair shares a faction goal, they also have personal goals that conflict.  For example, Merchant A wants a compromise with the Count over taxes, but Merchant B is a die-hard revolutionary and wants independence from the Count.  Adventurer A is a Fighting Man who is sick of dungeon delving and wants to develop a reputation as a trusted mercenary leader, but Adventurer B is a Magic-User who feels that s/he should be in charge of the party and finds that kind of body guard work demeaning.<br/><br/>I'm also trying to set these characters up so there is flexibility regarding the number of players.  With 3 players and a Ref, only the "A" characters are played and the "B" characters are controlled by the Ref.  If you want to try to get a "B" character to do something, you have to make an Engle Matrix argument and the roll is modified by the Ref according to whether it aligns with the B character's goals.  With 4 or 5 players, one or two of the B characters will remain unused, but I won't be sure which ones until I have them all written up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203820/#Comment_203820" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T08:26:23+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  8:26AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that you're planning ahead for different configurations and numbers of players.

I was going to write up 2 characters for  the definite NPC factions (at least) and give them Goals.  They could be used in the case of more players, which would take the total up to 10.  Note: If they are not used and remain NPCs, they would not be actively pursuing any goals.  They would be there more or less as resources for the other players.  I.e. the player of the Count's Man tries to make a deal with an NPC Rival Adventurer, and the success is modified based on whether or not it aligns with the NPC's goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204081/#Comment_204081" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T06:01:04+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  6:01AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2009 6:30AM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what's the next step for you then, John?<br/><br/>For me, I still need to write up any brief fiction and player handouts. I figure those will take the form of faction info on one siude and bullet points of rules on the other. I was going to go whole hog with the minis, but I think maybe hacking out some usable if not pretty stuff, and getting a playtest in within the next two weekends is the more useful thing for me to do right now.<br/><br/>Although, a weird thought that occurs to me is: Do these things actually go beyond a playtest stage?<br/><br/>Paul B:<br/>If you're still following along, I thought a bit more about something you'd asked me about the referee's role. I'm thinking you have to think of it a bit paradoxically.<br/><br/>On one hand, the referee is very likely to be the game creator, so that person is both the mechanistic diety, and a party host of sorts. In a very real way, the creator and ref  has a vested interest in the success of the game on a sheer, personal social level. OTOH, it's a clockwork situation: The creator puts the parts in place, winds up the spring tension, then has to back off, which is again a slightly different role.<br/><br/>In fact, it's a role that JDCorley seems to advocate for game designers a lot around these parts: Basically, accept that once the game  is created and in the hands of players, the designer really ought to piss off and accept that players are gonna fold, spindle and mutilate the creation as they see fit. Except, in this case, the designer doesn't have the nicety of his baby being in hands of folks somewhere out in the ethereal realm of the intertron- he's still right there at the table.<br/><br/>So, I'm not quite sure what the answer is. Perhaps the answer is found partly in the one-off nature of these things.<br/><br/>The goal really isn't to create something for the ages, it's to create something that works once, for a few hours. And it might not be to create direct replicatable results, but simply to find tools usable for creating the next one, and possibly to share those tools with other folks interested in the form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204170/#Comment_204170" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T10:25:22+00:00" title="April 29, 2009 10:25AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob -<br/><br/>I like your approach with the dice economy.

A quicky way to get some nifty looking art for the circles/locations would be to take the front facades from paper model buildings, print just that off (you wouldn't need to put together the whole model), and paste them to the board.<br/><br/>There are tons of them around.

They each have their own personal goals as well as sharing an appetite for rising as high as they can (which is likely to mean: higher than any other PC).<br/>The "map" is actually an organization chart for the company - and PCs get to literally <i>move </i>within it, of course.<br/>There are no established "combat" rules in the traditional sense (should somebody recourse to the rather unorthodox tactic of perpetrating physical violence on co-workers, such a move gets adjudicated by the referee); but there's supposed to be a full set of <b>social combat</b> mechanics, so that common interactions such as bluffing, seducing, intimidating or blackmailing colleagues can most often be resolved with no referee intervention.<br/><br/><b>pros and cons:</b><br/>The setting for this scenario is <i>very</i> similar to the one of the game I'm (most likely to be) designing for the Random Cover Contest. Not quite sure whether this is a "pro" or a "con".<br/><br/><br/><br/><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><b>ARMOR OF THE GODS</b></span><br/><br/>A (long) scenario (or maybe a short campaign) for my favourite minis game: Vincent Baker's <i>Mechaton</i>. Set on planet Troy, in a sci-fi version of the Iliad, where the Greeks are invaders from a different planet and the heroes are ace pilots fighting the war with their powerful mechs.<br/>Player characters are pilots whose profiles are loosely (?) based on the heroes of Homer. They are formally arranged in two factions, but have a number of conflicting individual goals and victory conditions seeding discord between same-faction pilots.<br/>The game starts with a truce, so no mech-to-mech fighting can officially happen and players have to advance their own goals by different means. Should the truce be broken, though, or should the game last long enough that the truce is over and fighting is resumed, the standard <i>Mechaton</i> rules (maybe with some ad hoc fiddling) are used to play out battles.<br/>I'm envisioning a large scale strategic map built with LEGO bricks, while any battles are to be fought on a separate table, on the standard <i>Mechaton</i> scale.<br/><br/><b>pros:</b><br/>- Should the "Braunstein" part of this "Braunstein" fall flat for any reason, the evening can still be salvaged by playing <i>Mechaton</i> battles, as <i>Mechaton</i> is lots of fun.<br/>- LEGO bricks = love.<br/><br/><b>cons:</b><br/>- Depending on the amount of actual fighting happening, the game may turn out too long to play to its conclusion in a single day.<br/>- Playtest and satisfactory play both seem to require a large group of players who are already familiar with <i>Mechaton</i>; unfortunately, I don't have such a group handy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That's it.

Wish me good luck, will you?<br/><br/>BTW, I can still use "minis" of sort in Braunstein, inc. - even if just as markers on an abstract progress grid, much like the one in Grey Ranks maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204974/#Comment_204974" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T22:25:04+00:00" title="May  2, 2009 10:25PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2009 10:28PM by komradebob.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck! I'm looking at making another cross-Atlantic trip in about a month and a half, and god knows, anything that occupies you is a good thing. I can't even imagine the Italy-Japan trip time and what that's like!<br/><br/>I think your idea has lots of potential to be a really interesting game, Rafu. I can't wait to see what you come up with.<br/><br/>Jon: I'm looking at an add-on "bullet-time" sub-system for <i>Maladicion</i>. I'm not sure if it can be any help to you, but my idea was to encourage fun, but short, combat periods ( which does fit with the heavily armed and monstrous characters involved with mine).<br/><br/>Basically, during a turn, any player can call for events to bullet time (as per David Berg's pacing arc). This shift-down can be contested like anything else by other players.<br/><br/>Assuming events go into bullet-time, each involved player can roll one die from their cup of any type. Players are not required to roll a die, and all dice to be rolled should be placed out under each player's hand before any are rolled. In other words, players are NOT allowed to pick their die or change their die due to seeing the results obtained by other players.<br/><br/>This is the number of d6s they will recieve for the turn's bullet time. The referee will have a special set of d6s for this purpose, which are distinct from any others used in the game. <br/><br/>The referee watches as each player rolls in turn, and gives the player the rolled number of bullet-time d6s.<br/><br/>The turn action then goes into a slow-motion combat mode. It is still a free-play style of action. The player with the greatest number of bullet-time d6s has the initiative to start.<br/><br/>They begin describing actions for one character at a time. These actions should be small- a quick move, a draw and fire, ducking behind nearby cover, and so on.<br/><br/>Parallel to the main rules, thes actions can be interrupted/contested by another player. Contests occur as usual, with outcome setting and the referee insuring equitable outcome stakes on each side.<br/><br/>During the bullet-time, players may use other dice from their cups and add d4s to their rolls as normal, in addition to or instead of their bullet-time d6s. <br/><br/>The referee can use their dice in their bowl as usual, if necessary to decide order of events.<br/><br/>If a player has one of their described actions contested and it goes to a contest roll-off, the winning player gains or maintains initiative, but loses their die. A losing player retains their die. On a tie, reroll results.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, or at the end of bullet-time, all bullet-time d6s return to the special pile of bullet-time dice. Players may NOT retain them for other use.<br/><br/>I <i>think</i> this will help with the dice impoverished situation, while still allowing for action movie style combat to occur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9120/a-braunstien-contest-no-workshop" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9120/a-braunstien-contest-no-workshop" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9120/a-braunstien-contest-no-workshop/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9120%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9120%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
