At the same time, fight for justice as the Cops on their tail.  Your roll reverses during play as you stitch together the story of a grand and daring caper.<br/><br/>So... this is a bit freestyle.  Pretty loose, but what do you think?

First player chooses a game setting (Industrial London, an Arabian oasis, etc.).  The next clockwise player chooses the <b>Loot</b> (the target).  The next chooses the name and ethics of the <b>Gang</b>.  Then the discussion begins:<br/><br/>1) Plan - What is the loot, where is it, what sort of security is there? etc.<br/>2) Prep - Do you need dynamite, guns, a translator?  Should you bribe anyone?  That sort of thing.<br/>3) Caper - The actual theft itself.<br/>4) Getaway - Flee! Or get into cool disguises.<br/><br/>Whenever someone brings in a new idea or suggestion, this is called a Caper Scene.  It can happen in any part of the game.<br/><br/><b>You'll need:</b> A pack of playing cards, As-7s and Jokers removed so there's only 24 cards (8s, 9s, 10s, Js, Qs, Ks).<br/><br/><b>Caper Scenes</b><br/>It could be anything from, 'There's going to be this super narcissistic security guard on the gate', to, 'We'll need a plane for the Halo jump.'  As a Robber, your job is to set up and complete the robbery.  Once you make any kind of suggestion toward that goal, draw a card.  If it's a face card, it's a success.  Put the card aside (these add up as Robber Points later) and describe the successful results.  Yay!<br/><br/>If it's not a face card (8, 9, or 10), you've got to describe the failure instead and you discard the card.  Boo.<br/><br/><b>Cops</b><br/>If ever you draw a <b>spade</b>, you are converted from a Robber to a Cop.  If it was a face card, the card <i>still </i>goes to the Robber Point pile.  Immediately, it is your job to describe how the Cops are proceeding with their investigation.  As above, you draw a card and Face cards mean success (Put the card aside, as a Cop Point) and describe the effects.  A number card is a failure and is discarded.  In this case, describe the failure instead.<br/><br/><b>Turncoat</b><br/>After the Cop arrives on the scene, each group takes turns describing their actions, Cops / Robbers / Cops / Robbers / Etc.  <i>After</i> the Cop's first turn, if they draw a spade, they are turned back into a Robber.  In this fashion it is possible for a Cop to revert to a Robber or for there to be many Cops and many Robbers.<br/><br/><b>Game Over</b><br/>When the deck of cards runs out, the robbery is complete.  Total Robber Points (face cards from Robber Caper Scenes) and Cop Points (from Cop Caper Scenes).  The highest wins and gets to describe the resolution in whatever manner they desire.<br/><br/><b>Gambling Your Cards</b><br/>When you are about to draw a card, you may opt to gamble one of your Robber/Cop Points.  Instead of drawing one card, you draw two and take the best one.  If there are no successes (no face cards), you lose the gambled Robber/Cop Point too.  Oops.<br/><br/>That's it... So, any ideas?  Suggestions?  Should I trash it or write it?  Be cruel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
