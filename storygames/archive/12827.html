To balance the economy a little, we dropped to d8's for complications - just big enough to still make a profit on your complication.<br/>- Instead of bidding for scenes, we took turns.  Player A, Player B, Player C, repeat.<br/>- We refreshed every three scenes, only 3 coins each.  (I think this was a little low, but we survived.)<br/>- We had a really mild "character ownership" gimmick - you could pay one coin for the fact that you own a character - so if someone tried to control it for you you'd have double-force power to challenge.<br/><br/>Things we never did, not because we ruled them away, but just because:<br/>- created master / sub components<br/>- bought extra dice for complications;  we only bought traits<br/><br/>We got through a tenets phase and seven scenes in under two hours.  And, when we ran out of time at the end, and wanted to go to bed, but were really only halfway through the story, one of the players just quickly summarized the rest of the plot, and the other two made amendments ("What about Harriet?  We introduced her tesla coil experiment, aren't we going to use it to stop the aliens?"  "Oh, sure, Dirk must walk into a transformer and get zapped and be freed from the alien influence, so she'll grab her tesla coil and zap all the infected until the invasion is neutralized.") until we were all happy.<br/><br/>What tech do y'all use to play remotely?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288814/#Comment_288814" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T12:13:57+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 12:13PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wikis for asynchronous play with some coin-tracking stuff programmed in.<br/><br/>The first thing I ever played on IRC was Uni, and I recall that we renamed ourselves constantly to track coins in our bank but I really can't recall how we tracked components.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
