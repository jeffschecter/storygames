So, so fun.<br/><br/>I turn to Shannon and start the game: "You wake up with Bondo's knife to your throat. 'Give me the key, bitch, or you die now.' What do you do?" That's what the game tells me to do. Make as hard a move as the fiction allows so that 1) I can set up a future harder move and 2) I prompt action from the PC.<br/><br/>Shannon's skinner fucks that guy up real good (of course, and fuck him, I'm looking through crosshairs).<br/><br/>But now we know that Roark's men can get to her in her freakin' bedroom, whenever they want. Shannon gets distracted with other stuff and does nothing about this fact. No new security or bodyguards or nothing.<br/><br/>So now: The rules say when my plans come together without interference, make as hard a move as I want. So later (at my leisure, when it's right) my move is 'Capture Someone.'<br/><br/>It's so very fun and easy. I <i>loooooove</i> the GM rules for this game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249588/#Comment_249588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-04T15:56:01+00:00" title="January  4, 2010  3:56PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2010 3:58PM by Alex F.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Saturday, it's Montsegur 1244. <br/><br/>Bertrand stands accused of breaking his vow of consolamentum with Arsene some years back.

We rolled up characters and wandered through the introductory adventure.  One of our players had never played anything but Story Games and another had never played RPGs at all.  The rest were versed primarily in trad gaming and me, nerd of the hour, had significant experience across the board.<br/><br/>I loved it.  They all loved it, too.  It's a lot of fun to have a play space to call your own - cards, sheets, a miniature, slotted abilities.  They played a bunch of brash loudmouths whose Party Tension rose and fell like crazy as the game went on.  <br/><br/>Some comments ranged from "It was really confusing at first but by the time we were done I felt like I understood the rules really well.  The cards made it considerably easier to remember everything I could do." to "I like this game.  I don't feel as pressured to be 'creative' all the time."  <br/><br/>Rousing good fun, though it felt more like a night playing board games than an intense roleplaying experience.

Eppy, Vincent and Ben are playing grumpy old men; Eppy and Vincent's characters are ex CIA, but Ben's was a secret agent from China who worked missions with them before everything went horribly wrong. Emily was playing the young upstart, brand-new to the team on the mission that went to shit, so everything was clearly his fault. <br/><br/>There's a car chase across rural New York: Ben's character is going nuts because his daughter-in-law kidnapped his grandson. His grandson is everything to Ben's character; he's been teaching the kid how to fight and shoot a gun since he was barely able to walk, and his own son won't speak to him, so his daughter-in-law was his only connection to the kid.<br/><br/>Mission starts. During Mission, the players work out their elaborate plan of action, and I work out the plans of all of the NPCs. We do this at the same time; not everything is contested because neither side knows everything. They get to the farmhouse where Ben's daughter-in-law is picking up new papers for her and her son. Ben's character works like a machine, liquid awesome, tries to tackle his daughter-in-law. Fails. Didn't put enough prep dice in neutralizing her. Out of desperation, he tosses his gun to his grandson.<br/><br/>His grandson points the gun at him. "Stay away from my mom." I reveal: the kid put three dice in "Protect my mom."<br/><br/>Eppy, Ben, and Vincent also had a great torture scene at a HoJo.

Oh, they also discovered a note from a low ranked Priest of Sigmar implicating him in the Cult's plot and also referring to a Child who the group just so happened to discover may be Sigmar Reborn (they furiously re-wrote Beliefs, especially the humans).  <br/><br/>Awesomeness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249623/#Comment_249623" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-04T22:49:12+00:00" title="January  4, 2010 10:49PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agony -&gt; I'm guessing you added the "Beliefs" to the game or I've missed something very important about WHFRP 3e                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249626/#Comment_249626" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T00:49:48+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 12:49AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Saturday, it's Montsegur 1244.<br/><br/>Pierre-Roger and Bernard are on a sortie in the fog.

Third mission, the squad is moving through an asteroid field made from a planet blown up by 15th brigade. Some renegade troopers have hijacked the cold sleep module with all the reserves and hidden it in the asteroid field. The leuitenant is frustrated that he hasn't leveled anything and tells the corporal with the most kills to stay back and watch their rear while the others scout ahead but he refuses. The leuitenant has at several points threatened to frag the corporal for hurting the squad with bad grenade usage and now they start fighting, the corporal uses a strength to win and frag the leuitenant to gain control of the squad but he uses a weakness to escape and calls in orbital bombardment. Killing all the reserves (800+ kills!). Then he manufactures a lie about the renegades unfreezing and brainwashing the reserves so he got out of it without any shit except everyone hating him.<br/><br/>Also when the squad was competing against another squad for most kills the two squad leaders bump in to each other before a mission:<br/>"I feel like shooting you right here, right now, but I wouldn't want a head start."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249641/#Comment_249641" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T05:47:28+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  5:47AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>Agony -&gt; I'm guessing you added the "Beliefs" to the game or I've missed something very important about WHFRP 3e</blockquote>\nYes, we added them.

Captain Vance (PC) wakes up in an opulent suite in a hotel in Nightport lying beside Lady Blackbird (NPC).  Surpise!  The player had no idea this bang was coming.  Neither of them recall with great detail how they ended up together and before they can sort out how they feel about the situation, they're interrupted by the sounds of explosions outside as the Hand of Sorrow begins bombing all of Nightport to flush out Lady Blackbird!<br/><br/>Next scene with Captain Vance is a flashback to the night before's party in the hotel restaurant with Lady Blackbird and her bodyguard Naomi (PC), where Lady Blackbird explains why she is seeking out the Pirate King (it wasn't for love, it's because she knew she'd be disowned and hunted and Flint would protect her long enough for her to recoup her losses and move to take over her house again) and she and Captain Vance drunkenly flirt with each other, seamlessly setting up the intro scene.<br/><br/>A couple scenes later in The Owl, Arkam awakens from a drunken binge (he was beaten up by Naomi a couple nights previously) with some pressure on his chest.  When he opens his eyes, the escaped-slave-barbaric elf girl Briarea (NPC that Naomi had taken under her wing) is crouched on his chest, peering into his eyes while he slept.  When Arkam asks her to get off his chest, she refuses until he explains how it seems Arkam knows her.  After some tete a tete, she finally realizes that Arkam is the one who sold her into slavery (this was all engineered by Daniel Perez <i>during the scene</i> without me realizing it so when Briarea came to the realization, it was because I did!

The PCs were The Fall Guy, Robocop, Sledge Hammer, and Xander Harris (from Buffy). Mr. T sent them on a mission to bust drug runners, who turned out to be led by Danny Tanner (Full House). The players took the Guest Star stuff as an excuse to make their characters completely bizarre (though Xander's Egyptian adventure, Robocop had "Strength of Ra" as an Aspect, for example), which gave it kind of a Maid RPG feel in terms of sheer randomness.<br/><br/>Not sure I handled it as well as I could have, since the adventure was a set of fight scenes, and the PCs never took many consequences. I don't know if it's good or bad that rolls made without invoking an aspect were by far the exception to the rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250567/#Comment_250567" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T19:46:04+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  7:46PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few weeks ago we played <a href="http://www.latorra.org/trampstamp/" rel="nofollow">Tramp Stamp</a>.

They stop at an abandoned fortified inn within the forest, clearly ransacked by the Crusade and left in complete disarray with no one in sight.  They bar up the large doors and spend the night there awaiting for the storm to break.  <br/><br/>During the night, Friedrich (a Sigmar Zealot PC) is accosted by a woman who appeared within the walls from practically nowhere.  She begs for him to open the gate so that her companions can get in.  Some commotion ensues as the PC's try to find out what is going on and a small crowd of cloaked travellers can be seen banging upon the large wooden doors.  That is when a Beastmen horde from the surroudning forest descends on the fortified inn.  <br/><br/>Despite the wailing cries of a baby, the screaming of several women, and two weak men pleading for their lives, they watch the entire lot of them get slaughtered by the hounds of Chaos.  Why?  Because they discovered the woman was a mutant, in which Friedrich immediately pinned her to the wall and took her head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250937/#Comment_250937" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T18:53:50+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  6:53PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Swashbuckling politics and blood game.

As John said this week: "I don't know why this anime hasn't been made. It writes itself."<br/><br/>The squadron recently met Brunhilde, the original bad girl with unresolved daddy issues about Odin, and they first encountered her while she was in the middle of having loud sex with her boyfriend, a fire demon gangster boss they'd previously tangled with. Using her help, they head out onto the branches of the World Tree to see why giant leaves are beginning to fall all throughout Midgard.<br/><br/>While most of the squadron goes to investigate the rot spreading out from Midgard to the rest of the tree, Brunhilde and Kara (the most reckless valkyrie left since John's character went through a conversion) sit talking about their ultimate goal: killing Odin, who apparently didn't have the balls to die during Ragnar\xf6k so the world could be reborn, so everything is stuck and getting worse all the time.  Brunhilde convinces Kara that they should head back to Midgard without the rest of the squadron and kill Odin, since they're unsure how the rest of the valkyries will feel about it.<br/><br/>Brunhilde tries to leap back into Midgard, the fruit hanging from this rotten branch of the tree... and rolls 1 success, totally failing.  As she falls, she grabs onto the bottom of the world, dangling briefly, and decides -- fuck this -- if she's going to fall off the World Tree into hell (which lies amidst the roots), she's taking Midgard with her, and begins trying to yank the rotten fruit off the branch.  So Kara shoots Brunhilde in the head with an arrow and watches her body fall down into the fires far, far below, in effect saving the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251640/#Comment_251640" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T16:03:05+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  4:03PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time &amp; Temp again, this time revolutionary France - our temps are their to prevent the theft of Robespierre's head<br/><br/>They go to the Palais de Justice and learn from the guards that the executioner Jean Marie Arouet (well, I had to think of a name, his real one was Henri Sanson) lives in a street just behind.

In the last session, before the Holidays, Samuel Maverick and Ezekial had decided to leave Boston to starve and set up their own community around the old Maverick house on Noddle Island (about where Logan Airport is today). We had a new NPC, the long lost blind Maverick sister who grew up as an orphan on the streets of New York, Joanna Abraham.  <br/><br/>We had had some table talk about how Noddle Island probably had ghosts and weird stuff going on. That pretty much provided the meat for the session.<br/><br/>Joanna gets dragged to Noddle Island to check in on the street urchins Zeke and Sam brought with them. The boat they came in leaves early after Sam grabs his gun and tells the person leading this little trip to the island (Sam's brother, Anthony) to get off his land. This leaves Sam, Zeke, the urchins, Joanna and her companion on the island as a storm rolls in.<br/><br/>I then spent the next couple of hours finding out just how fun and easy it is to run light horror with a blind PC. Sam and Zeke ran off into the woods to investigate some odd happenings leaving two young women alone with a bunch of kids in a storm. As a GM, sometimes you have to work for it, and sometimes the PCs just give it to you.<br/><br/>It also says something about the game that every time I think I can write up the whole session in a paragraph, it turns into a short essay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252306/#Comment_252306" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-24T02:15:29+00:00" title="January 24, 2010  2:15AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In A Wicked Age:<br/><br/>Cultists have a hungry devil to appease, one PC and NPC fight as to who will be sacrificed, and I win.<br/><br/>Me: "How about the demon kills and eats you"<br/>Him: "Sure!"<br/><br/>(He spent the rest of the chapter as a ghost)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252312/#Comment_252312" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-24T02:42:28+00:00" title="January 24, 2010  2:42AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two playtests of Xenoraptor.<br/><br/>*In the first, aliens were scarce and what few of them poked their heads from the shadows got turned into minced meat.

I thought we were on the same page, until the Imbolc festival where I'd planned to incite the people to rise up once and for all, and storm the Viking Keep. In comes Moira, with a shroomtastic "Hero's Brew" for the warriors to drink, and a sack thickly dripping red. She makes a speech about tonight being a time for heroes, declares that the time has come to go forth and slay the oppressors...<i>to storm and massacre the Abbey!</i><br/><br/>She empties her sack and it contains the head and hands of the Abbot, slain as an Imbolc Sacrifice! The people are confused, and Gabhran's aghast. He rallies his wits and makes a speech that respects Moira's spiritual position (he NEEDS that legitimacy!) but stresses the need to send the Norsemen packing FIRST! A hot roll and some Artha later, and Gabhran's got 6 successes toward having all the able-bodied men storm the castle!<br/><br/>Their people on the inside open the gates to them, and the mob begins to rush in--just as Matt's PC Nuallan, Irish Prince who wants peace with the Norse, arrives with a company of Vikings. He calls out to them to stop, making the case that bloodshed is unnecessary: a Gaelic boy, adopted by the Norse, can ascend to the Chieftancy and satisfy both groups. But Nuallan's got to beat my 6 Let It Ride successes to deter the crowd.<br/><br/>After a pile of Artha and a Trait reroll it comes down to a single die rerolled from a Fate Point for his final needed success...and comes up 1. As the mob decries him and advances, Nuallan rushes out in front of them, and is trampled to death! Gabrhan cries out, not wanting Nuallan dead--but if he wants to reign the mob in now, then <i>he</i> needs to overcome the 6 Let It Ride successes! There is nothing for him to do but surge forward with the tide of his "army," slaying and weeping in a frenzy.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253095/#Comment_253095" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T08:49:55+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  8:49AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco last night, testing out a new playset, we had fun with flashbacks and time jumps around an Object: The corpse of a German prisoner of war.

Three Wraiths ram the Crew's boat.  Coil walks on water towards his mortally wounded mother.  Grip harpoons the wraith Charon to the bow.  Demon, terrified, dares to attack Charon hand-to-hand, amalgamating his own body of light with that of Charon's dark forgetfulness.  Both tumble overboard and are seen no more.

I'm a librarian and most/all of the players are, too, thus <a href="http://friendfeed.com/libdelve" rel="nofollow">Library Delve</a>.<br/><br/>I adjusted the Rootless Wanderer Google Mechanics to be more random. Here is <a href="http://ff.im/fhdKp" rel="nofollow">an excerpt from today's encounter</a>:</span></i><br/><br/>ENCOUNTER--INF____TION COMMONS<br/><br/>You walk down a short, wide stairway into a large open area east of the Lantern Entrance. On the wall is a damaged sign that now says "INF____TION COMMONS." From the look of things, it's easy for you all to fill in the missing letters. You are in the Infestation Commons.<br/><br/>The furniture was likely bright and cheerful when it was new, but generations of occupation by rats and insects and worse have obscured the colors. The walls are shiny and white and covered in slogans such as MANGOR CATALOGING RULES! The tables and chairs are unlike any you have seen before, all with wheels and odd shapes and angles. Most of these are broken, but there are enough intact that you have interrupted a chair race. A mixed group of kobolds, orcs, goblins, and gnolls push each other across the commons, scattering vermin as they run and laugh, and slam into the whiteboard walls.<br/><br/>Normally these different monsters would fight among themselves, but the Infestation Commons seems to have taught them to excel at groupwork. They attack with COLLABORATIVE VIOLENCE!<br/><br/>COMBAT: The monsters use "collaborative violence" as their attack. A Google search returns 3,900,000 hits for "collaborative violence" without quotes. Adding the digits 3 + 9 + zeroes, we get twelve (12) which is their attack score. You must choose your weapon or ability (from your character's ID in the previous thread) to counterattack! If the sum of your digits is equal to or greater than twelve, you win the combat; if less than twelve, the monsters get their licks in before running away (no one gets killed here--yet). In the comments, report what attack you used, your attack score, and narrate the result of the action.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE: Magical Johnny uses his Mock Swedish ability. The Google result for "mock swedish" (no quotes) is 625,000. Attack score: 6+2+5+zeroes = 13, or a win. He stands his ground and shouts "Bjore de floo ne deeta borga kobold orciee!"  This actually sounds a lot like "I have the plague; may I please borrow your handkerchief?" in orcish. The monsters give Johnny a wide berth, in search of less-contagious combatants.<br/><br/><i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">I'm pleased with where the players have gone with it. Here's one example, many more in the <a href="http://ff.im/fhdKp" rel="nofollow">full FriendFeed thread:</a></span></i><br/><br/>Lance de Pants charges boldly into combat wielding his longsword (615,000=12=win, just)! He seems to have learned his combat style from watching action movies with invulnerable heroes, but so far it's doing the trick and he looks damn good doing it. He skewers the vile beasts two and three at a time as his Shield of Reflection deflects most of the gore from his gleaming chainmail and onto his foes and fellow adventurers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254482/#Comment_254482" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T10:18:45+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 10:18AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Last Train Out of Warsaw: Ukrainian partisans get 20% of the gold, although they don't know it; the Red army gets 80%.

Big is a relative term -- it's like a few hundred people. All the gaming happens in one ballroom, which also houses a few vendors, and then there's a seminar room down the hall. But it's one of the places WotC announces new product, and it's a huge deal for Living Forgotten Realms. It marks the start of the new LFR year, and they try new stuff there, and so on.<br/><br/>The big new shiny thing this year was LFR's first Battle Interactive, entitled The Paladins' Plague. Apparently they did these a lot for Living Greyhawk, but this was the first one for LFR. They ran it twice, once on Friday and once on Saturday. We played on Friday, after we'd gotten our characters into the level 7-10 band, which is where we wanted to play it.<br/><br/>The way it worked: there were like 35-40 tables, all playing the same scenario. All 200 or so PCs were in the same place at the same time. There's this city in the Forgotten Realms, Elturgard, and it was under siege by some horrendous monsters. Our collective job was to do something about it. So one guy, the author, stood up in the middle of the hall and described the scene: all of us, gathered with the paladins of Elturgard, and a speech being delivered, and something bad happening in the middle of it. Panic in the streets. We were charged with protecting the citizens of the city. Each table's GM put down the same map, and we had like an hour and fifteen minutes to go running around trying to keep monsters from breaking into houses and killing the innocents inside.<br/><br/>Our table saved 10 out of 12 citizens, which was a total success. An hour and fifteen minutes later, the whole room stopped playing no matter where they were and they totaled up all the citizens saved, and described the results based on the numbers. Then we went on to another mission with another goal somewhat more complex than just killing the monsters. If one table was doing really well, they could offer help, and another table could accept it, which would move some monsters from the troubled table to the successful table. I.e., reinforcements.<br/><br/>So we all played from 1 PM to 6 PM, then took an hour break for dinner, then everyone came back and we kept on going. One of the missions was really, really close -- we got exactly the number of successful outcomes we needed. One table doing a little bit worse would have been really bad. That ramped up the tension some.<br/><br/>At one point we were faced with a choice: take a rather dubious alliance, or go it alone? There was some argument, and everyone voted, and the majority ruled. There was a bit where we could sacrifice some life force to power a ritual, and if not enough people sacrificed enough life force, the ritual wouldn't work. There were some interesting consequences later on as a result, no matter which way we went. And in the end, around 11:30 PM, we saved the day and hurled back the invaders.<br/><br/>My little sorcerer, Reed, now has an official title: he is Reed Essinger, Defender of Elturgard. There is a monument named after him, no kidding. If I'm ever playing a scenario set in Elturgard I can say "oh, we'll hang out at the Reed Essinger Gilded Obelisk" and that's a true thing. (It could have been any public works project, or an orphanage, or whatever. I wanted an obelisk.) I have a piece of paper from Wizards of the Coast explaining all this.<br/><br/>This shared world stuff is pretty cool.<br/><br/>There were also a bunch of special adventures designed as preludes to The Paladins' Plague; we wound up playing ours after we played the main event, which was weird but we pretended it happened beforehand. So the whole weekend had a big storyline to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254510/#Comment_254510" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T11:59:31+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 11:59AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryant</cite>The Paladins' Plague</blockquote>\nThat sounds really fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254511/#Comment_254511" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T12:06:39+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Bryant</cite>The Paladins' Plague</blockquote>\nThat sounds really fun!<br/><br/>It was cooler than I expected it to be, in fact. Also: the level range was 1-17, so everyone at the con could play regardless.
