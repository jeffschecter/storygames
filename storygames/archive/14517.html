Most systems won't indicate mechanical resolution for everything that happens, though. I don't find the difference between mechanical and merely systematic very important, though, so insofar as I'm concerned it's all just playing to the procedure. Sometimes that procedure is all about freeforming the small stuff, sometimes it's important to roll dice for minor things to create randomized dissonance, sometimes the game requires you to actively avoid subject matter that can't be well-treated by the mechanical portions of the game. Lots of range in design out there, so I don't think it's very useful to generalize this as an universal question about using mechanics or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330637/#Comment_330637" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T15:12:02+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  3:12PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, could you give a concrete example of your bad experiences? That might help to understand where you're coming from - at this point, it's pretty abstract. <br/><br/><br/>I try to go by what the rules say, and if rules have wiggle room built in, I try to explain my decision to the other players. If a game is begging me to skip rules or change them around a lot, I stop playing that game - it isn't finished, or I just don't like it. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Harlequin</cite>Does anyone out there discuss what qualifies for an exception before play begins?<br/>Does anyone out there negotiate an exception as it happens?</blockquote>\nIf there's some kind of rule that we all know is poorly explained or poorly phrased, yeah, maybe we'll talk about it beforehand, or try and agree on how to interpret it, or discuss how we've interpreted it in the past. <br/>Generally, when making exceptions, it helps to pause play for at least two seconds in order to gauge any objections to the change OR to simply confirm that we're all okay with the idea. <br/><br/>As for this Social Contract stuff you're talking about... in my opinion, the only part of this that's Socially Contractual is explicating the expectation of house rules. But an individual game mechanic can be "freeform" without simply being part of the Social Contract. <br/>A "mechanic" is simply "the manner by which a given type of fact(s) is established through play." Doesn't matter if that means dice, or cards, or seeking consensus/agreement from the players and GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330655/#Comment_330655" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T17:14:16+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  5:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this seems a much too high-level a question for me to answer.<br/><br/>Like, I can say for certain, that if one option is ending the scenario prematurely, or resulting in character death, for my current group, I never pick that option, because they don't want either one.<br/><br/>I need more specifics before I can really answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330679/#Comment_330679" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T21:32:38+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  9:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies are in order, I think.

I will always, ALWAYS side with the actual real-life people around our gaming table over the cold, dead words of the rulebook.  That's just part of the "I only play games with my friends" deal, really.  If I favored the rules over our relationships with each other, I'd be a lousy friend.<br/><br/>That said, one of the elements of our particular social contract is that no one thinks being shut down is fun, unless there's a good, explicit reason for it.  So while it's often a no-brainer for a GM to skip a roll and just declare a character's action to be a success, it's less common for a GM to skip a roll and declare a failure; on the rare occasion when that happens, we ask why, and the GM either has a great answer for that or realizes, oh shit, I fucked that up, you really <i>should</i> roll for that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Harlequin</cite>Does anyone out there discuss what qualifies for an exception before play begins?<br/>Does anyone out there negotiate an exception as it happens?</blockquote>\nYes, and yes.  We have even started doing things one way, decided that it sucked, and immediately stopped and did it the other way instead!<br/><br/>Like Zac in Virginia, I think there's several reasons why we sometimes choose to set aside the rules, and different priorities for those reasons.  I think our group would put "social" above "logistics", but there's obviously a lot of overlap between the two.  (Something that takes an inordinate amount of time during the game to handle is often the same thing that some of us aren't interested in, so we'll just work around it instead.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330736/#Comment_330736" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T12:09:57+00:00" title="June 19, 2011 12:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Harlequin, it sounds like you don't want to use "social contract" as a guide in this, but in the end, it's <i>all</i> social contract.<br/><br/>The agreement to use a certain set of rules is social contract, and so is who gets to break or ignore them and when.<br/><br/>That might not be useful to you, so let me tell you when <i>I</i> choose to go around a mechanic.<br/><br/>A) When the rules tell me to, hopefully with advice on when and how that should be.<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> When it becomes obvious that it's going to completely destroy everything.<br/><br/>Otherwise I like to follow the rules.
