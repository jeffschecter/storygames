These national tension may have made independence less attractive. Perhaps this would have been the theatre for world war rather than Europe.<br/><br/>I can see a game of Cold City set in post-war Salt Lake City, a city divided between the Russian, Spanish and British Sectors over a local Mormon population. What demons lurk?"</i><br/><br/>I find this idea tremendously exciting, as it hits so many buttons for me in terms of setting, background and so on. It could be a wonderful alt-history game. The combination of Imperial/colonial politics, the aftermath of a destructive war and the nature of the place itself just cries out for a game.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to need to do some work on this!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
