On the other hand, the language that the characters develop in order to communicate with each other is used to explore the whole tribal and pre-historic situation.<br/><br/>But what should the game be about in terms of content, for instance what makes for a good conflict in this game? What are characters and the players supposed to be doing? How should a GM develop the scenarios/situations/conflicts of the game in order to make them appealing for the other players?<br/><br/>I guess what I\u2019m asking is a kind of How To Play This Game guidelines,<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for all the help.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123803/#Comment_123803" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T13:38:23+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  1:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2008 1:39PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always played it pretty traditionally - there's a strong GM who throws adversity at the players.  Ideally conflicts that will leave the players with a lot of choices about how to approach and resolve them.  Here's one:<br/><br/><i>The pterodactyls are nesting on the cliff over your village all of a sudden and, sooner or later, they are going to steal a baby.  </i><br/><br/>That's a problem - do you want to go kill them all?  Do you want to put frickin' roofs on your huts?  If the players dither too long, steal a baby.  That's a whole other problem.  Have it rescued from the pterodactyl nest by another tribe and adopted.  Enough of this stuff and they'll start making their own problems among themselves, trust me.  Give them problems that are essentially social, group-cohesion testing problems.  Create NPCs with strong points of view.<br/><br/>I'd approach it like any other game - look for what the players care about (ask them and look at their characters) and then challenge that.  It's totally OK to talk when describing stuff, or explaining stuff - just no direct communication.  Leave space to get up and thrash around, and demonstrate that physicality is encouraged.<br/><br/>Is that helpful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123822/#Comment_123822" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T14:32:57+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  2:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason's pretty well hit the nail on the head. I play the game with a sort of light adventure bent, i try to get the players going on little missions, and then presenting them with complex situations (like dealing with other tribes who have different ideologies) they have to overcome as a group. The more open-ended the solution the better things are going to be.<br/><br/>The biggest lack of the book is that it doesn't really tell you what makes cool games (from a GM's perspective). Record of threats corrects this a little by giving you a bunch of NPCs and settings and stuff, but you don't need to buy more to make Primitive work. Just think of situations where normal play groups all express opinions and try to meet in the middle, then plunge your cave men into THAT problem. A few dinosaur attacks and crazy caves full of glowing crystals or bear people also works pretty well.<br/><br/>Thanks for picking up the game. I hope this helps, if not, keep asking (or if you have other questions) and i'll tell you whatever i can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123823/#Comment_123823" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T14:34:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  2:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2008 2:34PM by J_Walton.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't really want to overthink Primitive.  I don't think Kevin's trying to say anything especially deep about civilization and violence.  I think he wants you to take your group of cavemen and fight giant sea kraken represented by packs of chewing gum, so you can use the gum pieces to make tentacles (this is what we did, last time Nathan ran it).  It's basically a fun miniatures combat game with the grunting and communication issues thrown on top of it, plus an invitation to engage in culture-building and social manuvering, like the baby-adoption stuff Jason is talking about.

It works pretty well however you play it. One of my playtest groups played a very true-to-anthropology Neandertal game and had a lot of fun dealing with burial rites and stag hunting and stuff.

Kind 'a like in a charade game.<br/><br/>Is this kosher for standard Primitive play? Do you guys feel like this needs to be treated like this or is it a subject that doesn't even come up on your games?<br/><br/>Thanks again for the help guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129935/#Comment_129935" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T09:38:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  9:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            first off, don't worry about hating, clearly, if your invested enough to write a forum post you have a like for the game. The criticism is totally valid and helpful.<br/><br/>Secondly, go ahead and try it. There is no right or wrong answer. I think it would probably slow things down a bit and cut out some of the punchiness of play, but if it's something you want to try with your group go ahead, more power too you. It could certainly get some interesting results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
