The result have been mixed.  Some pdfs can be read reasonably well and some are reader unfriendly.  The reader has a few more viewing options than the Kindle which is why I bought it.  I was wondering if any publishers or designers were releasing products in epub format.<br/><br/>I am aware of software like Calibre that allows you to convert.  I had a go with a 100 page pdf I had that was beautifully designed.  Basically I would have had to spend a number of hours reformatting the resultant mess into something usable.  I'd rather buy something completed than spend my time reformatting at a computer screen.  I bought the Reader specifically because it has a no-glare screen FFS.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301673/#Comment_301673" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T18:17:13+00:00" title="November 21, 2010  6:17PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've intentionally decided not to turn Sufficiently Advanced into epub format.

It might be easier than you think.<br/><br/>I used InDesign. Let me tell you, it is not. It was a total pain for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Numbers-ebook/dp/B003ZUY5ZI" rel="nofollow">24-page cookbook</a> with no pictures or tables. Of course, I also wanted fancy stuff like "white space," or even, "an extra line break between the end of the recipe and the name of the next dish." Had to add that sort of thing in the HTML directly, and ended up using their custom page-break tag rather than a paragraph with just a non-breaking space. I like how it ended up eventually... but it was two full days of screwing with settings and basically giving up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301969/#Comment_301969" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T14:20:11+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  2:20PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing about epub is that you have to mentally let go of certain things. You don't control the resolution. You don't control the pagination. You probably don't control the fonts. If you are used to micrometer control over layout, it can be difficult to give such things up. But epub isn't that kind of party. It is not at all about presenting the user with a work of art. It's about presenting the user with data that they control.<br/><br/>Even given that, the two things you mention are not particularly difficult to control just by changing CSS and not altering the HTML at all. While I could see that "an extra line break between the end of the recipe and the name of the next dish" is difficult, doing something in CSS that has the same visual effect -- like changing the "recipe" style to have a larger bottom margin -- is not and is more correct besides. Since InDesign will build you a file using named styles from its own style sheets, it should render the HTML just fine, and in a state fairly easy to tweak with CSS overrides. (Granted, the rendering in InDesign could do a couple of small things to make this much easier.)<br/><br/>The other thing InDesign does is allow you to base the ebub off the outline, rather than using the flow of the text. Since you can pretty much adjust the outline without effecting the layout within InDesign much, this is usually a lot easier than making the text flow work right, particularly for stuff like placing sidebars, images and tables within the flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_301987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301987/#Comment_301987" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T15:03:40+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  3:03PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Trevis</cite>There is an epub version of The Shadow of Yesterday out there.
