It can be knowledge in some written or physical record that maybe someone's looked at, maybe they haven't. It can be the result of applying rules processes that nobody's actually worked through yet. It can be pretty much anything, whatever.<br/><br/>The statements can be about imagined events. They can be about physical objects in the real world. They can be about logical entities that we need to know about in order to follow the game's rules. They can be about the social contract. Maybe these things are categorically different. Maybe it's not, whatever.\n<h1>Collions</h1>\nAs we play our game, we'll often discover that various reference frames are incompatible.<br/><br/>We'll be able to identify one frame of reference with greater authority. We'll update others as best we can to match the more authoritative reference frame.\n<h1>Privileged Frames of Reference</h1>\nSo how do we identify the privileged reference frame with more authority?<br/><br/>Totally depends on the social contract.<br/><br/>One group might invest greatest authority in the written module.<br/><br/>Another might invest greatest authority in the GM's private desires.\n<h1>How To Use This In Your Designs</h1>\nIdentify a reference frame that exists in your game, or introduce elements that create a new one.<br/><br/>Write a rule that specifies how much authority we'll invest in that frame of reference.<br/><br/><code>"Place one gold fish cracker in a bowl per ration available to the refugees. If you butcher a fellow refugee for food, place ten pieces of beef jerky in the bowl. Whenever a character consumes a ration, their player must eat a gold fish cracker or piece of jerky. Whenever a player eats a gold fish cracker or piece of jerky, their character eats a ration or hunk of human flesh. If your character must consume a ration but there is nothing to eat in the bowl, they starve and die."</code> (EDIT: This is from Jason Morningstar's never-published game Open Boat.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486446/#Comment_486446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-19T22:07:31+00:00" title="June 19, 2019 10:07PM">June 19</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2019 10:07PM by Jeph.">edited June 19</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Possibly useless elaboration. Here are some common reference frames used by rules.\n<h2>Shared Between Whom?</h2>\nWe like to talk about the Shared Imagined Space a lot. It's approximately equivalent to the linguist's idea of <a href="http://williamstarr.net/teaching/speech_acts/Stalnaker-2002-Common_Ground.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">common ground</a>, as relates to imagined events.<br/><br/>We tend to take it for granted that the whole group, everyone at the table, is Sharing in this here Imagined Space.<br/><br/>That's far from obvious, and rarely true!<br/><br/>We can, for example, communicate in ways that are only shared between a few people by design. I pass a note to the GM saying, "I dip my dagger in poison." Now, my poisoned dagger is in the common ground for me &amp; the GM. But not for anyone else!<br/><br/>Or somebody's out of the room when someone says something. I say, "I draw my sword!" and then Greg wanders back in from the restroom and says "So what'd I miss?". My bare sword is in the common ground for everyone but Greg!<br/><br/>Or, more often, people just forget things. Maybe I said an hour ago that I'm buying 300' of silk rope. We get to a pit. Greg looks up and says, "So, do we have any rope?"\n<h2>Private Beliefs</h2>\nWe all have private beliefs about imagined events.<br/><br/>I know my guy's short and stocky with tanned skin and high cheekbones and long white hair. If you ask me I'll tell you, but I haven't told you yet.<br/><br/>I ask the GM what I hear and she says "Footsteps from two pairs of feet, out of sight around the bend." She knows they belong to a pair of kobolds, but nobody else does yet.\n<h2>Physical Records</h2>\nWe all keep physical records of stuff going on in the game, both about fictional events and game rules.<br/><br/>My character sheet has my character's description and stats written out.<br/><br/>The damage dice I've just rolled for my Fireball, sitting on the table.<br/><br/>The miniatures we've placed on our battle map.<br/><br/>The module text.<br/><br/>Sometimes these physical records get out of sync with our private or shared beliefs. I wrote on my character sheet when I first created my guy that he's two meters tall, but I've been describing him as short the whole game! Or, the cat walks over the table and knocks around all our minis!<br/><br/>Sometimes the information in these physical records isn't known to anyone at all. The module we're playing through that has 100 pages that the GM hasn't read, yet. I haven't yet had a chance to look at my Fireball's damage dice and sum them up.\n<h2>Procedural Mandates</h2>\nWe've agreed to use rules. Those rules often mandate stuff.<br/><br/>Like, "When a Bag of Holding is placed within another extradimensional space, everything within 10' is sucked onto the Astral Plane."<br/><br/>Or, "A character at 0 HP is incapacitated and unconscious."<br/><br/>Or, "A Fighter's hit points at 1st level are 10 + Constitution modifier."<br/><br/>There's usually a bit of lag between us fulfilling the triggering conditions of this kind of mandate, and us working out the implications, and communicating them to everyone else.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486448/#Comment_486448" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-19T22:37:44+00:00" title="June 19, 2019 10:37PM">June 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this.
