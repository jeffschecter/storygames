I gave them a little peak at what kind of game it could be, and they liked it and wanted to try.<br/><br/>Chargen worked out as a sort of semi-formal interview session, with me asking IC questions and explaining mechanics at the same time. They took to the simple system well, and when they were done I took a short break to let them read the Blue-level information while I wrote up the Static list for the first mission.<br/><br/>It was a resounding success! The game played out like a noir-ish action-spy thriller (ala Jason Bourne) directed by David Lynch. Appearingly simple missions (we played two missions, onesimple get-in-get-out elimination of a HP, the other a delivery type mission with a femme fatale contact) turned horribly, horribly wrong when Control started giving contrary information and weird shit started happening.<br/><br/>In the end, the players were in awe, and atleast one of them said he is definately buying the game. They both declared it their absolute favourite indie rpg of all the ones weve tried (weve played DitV, Poisond and DRYH before this)!<br/>They loved the conspiracy feel of the games setting, the Lynch-esque surreal weirdness of Blue City and the frantic pace of the Heart Rate mechanic. When I explained how Static worked after we were done, their eyes lit up.<br/><br/>One phrase really sums up the session for us: You are not authorized for that information.<br/><br/>We are definately playing Lacuna again.

And Static, too.<br/><br/>How did you use Static? How did you track it? Did you have a Static chart? What was it?<br/><br/>I find it fascinating how it works out for different people. See, I'd never use the phrase "You are not authorized for that information". My Control is, by turns, charming, duplicitous and directive: "Hey, don't worry. We're behind you", "You have your orders, Agent". Lately, he uses management speak: "Cooper, we've been getting some comments about your performance".<br/><br/>And then our Blue City isn't Lynchian. It's either the Matrix or Vienna from The Third Man, with perhaps a touch of The Prisoner.<br/><br/>Yours sounds great. Glad it worked. Oh, it works really well for mini-campaigns, too. We did a run of three sessions, one mission for each session but getting deeper into the mystery each time. By the end, they worked out the mystery behind Blue City (which emerged from play). It was lovely.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107633/#Comment_107633" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T03:19:09+00:00" title="November 10, 2007  3:19AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>How did you use Static? How did you track it? Did you have a Static chart? What was it?</blockquote>\nI tracked static on a sheet of paper, without the players even knowing about the mechanic. Every time I noted a new point of static, they cringed. It was neat.<br/>I did use a static chart, and it was really cool. For me it worked sort of like an adventure outline, with the events I wanted to take place happening as Static increased.<br/>In retrospect I think Im going to change my approach to the Static chart, because I found myself pushing for more static to resolve the events I had planned, instead of going with what the players were doing. Im not sure what how I want to do it, but I do know that I dont want to do it like that again.<br/><br/>Some interesting issues cropped up in play that were fun to watch, and that Im going to have to look closer into to see how I want to run the game next time. Some help analysing it would be nice, actually.<br/><br/>The first issue was how fast Heart Rate ramped up! Every roll the players made increased their Heart Rate pretty severely, and when they failed rolls they increased Static instead, which could make things even more stressful. Im going to have to look into how Heart Rate works in play, because as it was the Agents barely had time to finish their missions before they flatlined. In fact, both missions I ran ended with the Agents flatlining and being ejected from Blue City, with Spidermen hot on their heels. Which was cool, but could get repetitive.<br/><br/>The second issue is related to the first, and has to do with Static. While Heart Rate shot through the roof pretty quickly, I found that Static increased agonisingly slowly. I would have wanted it the other way around, but we had fun with it.<br/>As I said, I found myself using Control to keep them in Blue City longer, and using the narrative control they allowed me (because theyre used to traditional GM/player structures) to extend the missions past the point where the Agents would have accomplished them in order to see my Static list completed. I dont know why that became so important to me,and Iwantto change that for the next time I run it to see how the game responds to that.<br/><br/>The third issue has to do with Commendation points. In our game, they played a very marginal role. Heart Rate increased so quickly that Commendation points hardly showed up at all, and the few that did show up were used pretty quickly on Access rolls (granted, they were Access rolls to get cool gadetry like night vision goggles and tommy-guns, but still).<br/>Which leads me to think that promotion wont come very quickly, but rather be a consequence of really long-term play. I dont know how I feel about that.<br/><br/>There was a fourth issue as well, but I forgot what it was while typing out the third one.<br/><br/>Anyway, we had an incredible time and Lacuna was really popular!
