(<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9120&amp;page=1#Item_92" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9120&amp;page=1#Item_92</a>)<br/><br/>I had a chance to try my design out this afternoon. I'm not really sure whether to call this thread an AP or a playtest, since it was a bit of both. I had only intended to run this game a single time, and because of the use of a particular collection of miniatures and terrain, it would be unlikely that anyone other than myself would run this scenario-game.<br/><br/>Also, while I very rapidly learned which mechanics worked well and which didn't, I doubt I'd ever use exactly the same set of mechanics in another scenario-game.<br/><br/>Roughly, this was a four-faction game, Banditos (Chris W), Mexican Army (Chris P), The Town Defenders lead by the Padre(Karen), and Count Dracula and his monsters (Andy). There were two referees ( Elliot Wilen and myself).<br/><br/>The setting was a small village in the Mexican desert in about 1919. There's an old abandoned monastery overlooking the town which had stored the not-quite-dead remains of Dracula. A couple of greedy villagers had broken into the monastery looking for treasure, but had awoken Dracula instead. There's also a buried treasure somewhere in town. The Banditos come looking for it, while the Mexican army is chasing after them. The padre and his soldaderas want to protect the town and Dracula naturally is Dracula, so you can guess what sort of stuff he's up to.<br/><br/>The game itself used minis and terrain to represent the area. Just prior to the game beginning, Dracula has scattered the horses of all factions, a conceit to isolate the play area.<br/><br/>Mechanics: <br/>The game used randomly dealt playing cards to determine the order that players were able to set scenes. The game was meant to be played over three days, and there were eight cards for each day ( two per player). Red cards were turns taking place during daylight, black after nightfall. Each day had a slightly different mix of cards.<br/><br/>Each player also recieved a cup of dice (4d6/ 4d8 /4d10). The referees also had a bucket of dice with ( 4d4/4d12/4d20). The dice were a straight meta-game mechanic. Characters had no stats whatsoever. A player could interrupt another player describing some event, describing an alternate direction for events. The interrupted player could compromise or it could go to a die roll-off. Players could choose among any of their dice available for this.<br/><br/>Refs were allowed and encouraged to make sure the stakes of a roll-off were acceptable to both parties and were roughly equitable.<br/><br/>After a roll-off the, loser kept their die, while the winner got their stakes added to ongoing events but lost the die to the refs' bucket.<br/><br/>Eah player recieved a handout giving a bit of backstory and giving conditions/objectives that allowed them to gain a die from the refs' bucket of their choice. The handout also included info on their starting characters and set up area.<br/><br/>Additionally, there was a "bullet time" subsystem, which essentially allowed a player calling for a zoom-in to bullet-time to roll (and expend) one of their dice and gain a number of d6s = to their roll. Any otherplayer could also jump in and do the same when bullet time was declared. each player had one "bullet-time" card that could use once per game.<br/><br/>Time limits: Each player turn was to last no more than 10 actual minutes, with the refs watching the timing and starting the clock when action began after scene-setting.<br/><br/>The Arneson factor: On each player handout, there was also a factional "BS" element. This was essentially an item or spare set of minis that didn't have any direct rules in the game, and it was left for the player to come up with a use for them. This was a nod to Dave Arneson's legendary out-of-game sneakiness in one of Dave Wesley's banana republic braunsteins. Use of this stuff ranged from a bit disappointing for one player through basically another player completely taking the game direction in an entirely different direction than I'd invisioned.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208909/#Comment_208909" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T19:22:21+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  7:22PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how'd it work out?<br/><br/>Well, I definitely rapidly learned a bunch of stuff about the design, good and bad.<br/><br/>On the good side, I felt that the players involved were definitely able to play a game with minis without anything approaching the more complex move and combat rules generally associated with minis play. Thee probably could have been some more info given, or at least GM guidelines on combat, but nothing hugely necessary.  Certainly, there should have been some advice on setting more non-death result stakes for combat.<br/><br/>As it turned out, the bullet time subsystem was largely unnecessary, and a bit confusing, even for me and I designed it. If I were to do a game like this again, I'd probably simply add more dice to the player's cups. Or maybe not.<br/><br/>The dice economy<br/>This definitely did not work as I'd planned. I threw a number of things into the game that gave dice back to players. I'd assumed there would be a scarcity of dice for players to use once play began, but that estimate turned out to be pretty much entirely wrong. If anything, dice could probably have been reduced for all players and the ref bucket.<br/><br/>The turns and scenes<br/>The turn cards seemed to work out fine, the time limits less so. While I might keep the time limits in place in some form, I'm not sure I'd work them quite the way I did here. I would rework the scene-setting. We didn't really enforce the part of scene setting involving a physical definition of "where" in a couple of early scenes, which lead to a couple of players starting off scenes that then immediately were jumped into by other players with minis essentially on the other side of the board. This showed a bit of a real problem with entirely free-form minis usage that probably would not have cropped up in a more traditional minis game. I personall think it could still be made to work with very little extra rules, but just a bit more enforcement of the guidelines already there.<br/><br/>In several cases, we simply let turns extend due to OOG discussion, stake-setting or rules questions. I think I'd put some other kind of limits in place.<br/><br/>The Arneson Factors<br/>The bandito player didn't really end up using his spare, undefined joker card to much of any special effect, and, I think was a bit disappointed. The Mexican Army player in theory would only have a total of 12 minis to use, although there were 18 on the side table. I didn't watch closely, and so all of them eventually turned up in play. It ended up a relatively unimportant factor either way. The padre player actually ended up using their undefined statue of Santa Lupita to argue for all kinds of miracles over time, many of wich simply went uncontested, and so by the weight of narrative precedent, in deedthe townsfolk did have some limited divine intervention in their favor over time.<br/><br/>Dracula? The dracula player got pretty much wiped out absurdly fast. However, I'd included a cthulhu mini ( Reaper Elder Demon) amongst his spare minis. Again, in theory, this monster should never have come into the game-it was meant strictly as an intimidation factor to use on the other players through BSing. Andy, however took it and plopped it down on the board at some point in jest near the last turn of the first day. That would have ended things, but other players decided to engage narration wise with "thooloo's arrival, so it became true-by-play.<br/><br/>How'd the game end?<br/>We actually never got to the third day. We'd taken a lunch break, came back and discussed the stuff that did and didn't work after playing day one, and made some modifications. We also agreed to play until the end of day two only, which really was fine with everyone.<br/><br/>Day one was spent with some investigating, a little player allying/betraying, and some nasty fights. The bullet-time rules were used unevenly, and didn't seem to add a lot for the addition of the extras special bullet-time dice. I'd probably keep the "zoom in mechanic" in some form but skip the actual extra dice part. There were bodies scattered hither and yon by the time midnight struck and day one ended.<br/><br/>Day two was all about the Cthulhu rampage. I also discovered that 3 of the 4 players who weren't really minis users got into massive destruction when using minis. Dynamitings, fires, cacti withered by the mere presence of Drac and Thulu, all kinds of stuff.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the banditos and soldiers had the treasure and had agreed to split it, provided that the they assassinate their own major, which they promptly did. Thulu had been forced into another dimension, but not before releasing a horde of lesser monsters. The monastery was bombed into oblivion by dynamite and set on fire, well, because!<br/><br/>As the bandito-soldier faction headed off into the desrt to go find a place to spend their ill-gotten loot, the poor besieged townsfolk, reduced to a single soldadera and a couple hastily armed peasants were preparing to make a final stand on the roof-top of the church as a ravening horde of demons swept over the village, 30 Days of Night style.<br/><br/>The winner?<br/>Chris P managed to score both the game win on randomly rolled Victory Points and the player chosen, secret vote MVP award.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208913/#Comment_208913" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T20:04:32+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  8:04PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2009 8:41PM by komradebob.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My general thoughts/observations:<br/><br/>At some point during play, we got into a disussion about the concept that the players weren't actually representing their characters in "actual" events, but rather that this was indeed a film that was being made, and that they vaguely represented various movie stars, directors, special effects people and screen writers, all battling it out for control of the film being made.<br/><br/>This actually made the game make a bit more sense.<br/><br/>I honestly don't recall the sequence of events in the body of the game except for broad impressions of lots of action, interspersed with a few rules discussions and ad-hoc clarifications. Elliot and I were mostly there to smooth over bumps or occasionally give our advice. We never had any real fiction input, so we were very much not the tradition GM figure, nor did we roll dice except on a few occasions ( maybe three times) where there were rather convoluted chains of "interrupts" and we need to have an "initiative" order established to figure it out.<br/><br/>Elliot was actually the more active referee, keeping track of time limits, offering rules clarifiaction suggestings, and acting as watch-dog for equitable stakes. I mostly acted as a final rules interpretation say-so guy, handed out award dice, and acted to remind players when they should get dice for situations, although after a couple turns they were largely watching for those themselves.<br/><br/>I'd call this a mixed success overall for me personally.<br/><br/>As a sort of test case to see if players could use minis and terrain but still have largely freeformish narration-based play with very simple player level mechanics, I'd rate it a B+, with that based on the clunkiness of the bullet-time subsystem I put in partly to comtrol somethingthat turned out not to matter much.<br/><br/>In terms of characterization/role-playing, I'd rate it as non-relevant. Not too much of any characterization really developed. The use of minis alone probably acted as a distancing factor, an the fact that players had multiple minis in their factions further diffused any particular urge they might have developed in that direction. I'd expect a game where each player only had one personal mini to see much more of that sort of thing.<br/><br/> Having built and now played this game, I've concluded that I really enjoy this sort of one-off scenario-game. I've also concluded that there really isn't any way to directly turn this sort of thing into a commodity to be sold; at most I might be able to write a text about what went into making this sort of thing, or how I might go about making a different one, and gering rules very specifically to an individual scenario-game. I'm not even sure I'd particularly want to replay this game, even with smoother modified rules. Not because it was a failure or less-than-complete success, but simply becasue it doesn't strike me as really very interesting to do so.<br/><br/>Edit: <br/>Also, before I forget, Big Thanks to Chris Hanrahan at End Game in Oakland for putting up with us hooligans while we played this today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208927/#Comment_208927" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T00:17:46+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 12:17AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was the Mexican Army in Robert's game. I had a fun time and I'm glad Robert (after much talk) finally ran his game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I liked using playing cards as the turn cards "clock". I didn't like the hard time limits. But if you limit the number of scenes, conflicts, or locales per turn card, we might actually make it to day 3. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I like the <i>idea</i> of bullet time, but it didn't differ much from regular play and was actually slower. It might work if it was some sort of fast-paced, back-and-forth roll-off between the players. I noticed that every player was interested in joining in a bullet time conflict during day 1, but no one did during day 2 after lunch.<br/><br/>As the Mexican Army, I had too many minis to invest much time in their characterization. I even lost count of how many men I had (and had killed). I think I was able to survive because most of our conflicts had "I die vs. you die" stakes, so my army could win by attrition.<br/><br/>I think your idea about the film as game would be fun. It might provide more opportunity for characterization, because each player might have a named actor characters. And there might be interesting opportunities for game rules bridging the film fiction vs the filmmaking. And if the named actor character can't die, players might raise more interesting conflict stakes than "I die vs. you die."<br/><br/>Overall, I think the playtest was very positive. There were some rules that didn't work as planned (like bullet time), but the players could roll with it because they generally agreed on which parts were working and which were not as important for our particular game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208984/#Comment_208984" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T11:47:27+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 11:47AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seeing that many playtests tend to break the given game within the first half hour, I think you had a very successful first play Robert!<br/><br/>Looks like you learned a whole bunch.<br/><br/>When is the next playtest scheduled, so I can get in??                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209013/#Comment_209013" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T14:58:53+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  2:58PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2009 3:13PM by komradebob.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>When is the next playtest scheduled, so I can get in??</blockquote>\nThat's the weird part; I don't think there is another game, not of Maladicion.

I'd made a nod towards emulation in the way different players gained dice, among them gaining dice when certain characters/minis died, several times when your own minis died. The second thing that threw that for an unforeseen loop was the speed with which the Dracula faction characters were wiped out.<br/><br/>So, I'd mostly envisioned the Mexican soldiers coming in in drips and drabs, and becoming casualties right and left, in the tradition of nameless recruit mooks in many action films, with just the Major, Sgt Garcia, and perhaps the bugler surviving to the "final reel", the rest being killed off by banditos or turned into monsters by Dracula's minions. Since you'd get a new die reward for every three that bit the dust in some fashion, I'd figured that your surviving figures would then become hardier due to you having more dice to act defensively with.<br/><br/>Turns out that my calculation on die pool losses by players were badly off mark, no one contested you bringing soldiers on to the board at all, and Dracula got wiped out so quickly that your fellows became a much more powerful faction than I'd foreseen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209093/#Comment_209093" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T10:08:57+00:00" title="May 26, 2009 10:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2009 10:16AM by komradebob.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a link ( I think) to the master document for this Braunstein:<br/><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=d2565ww_1hb2qjqhs&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=d2565ww_1hb2qjqhs&amp;hl=en</a><br/><br/>I actually created player handouts, extra player relevent rules packs, and a "Teacher's Edition" for the referee ( as Elliot put it ).<br/><br/>A couple of post-game thoughts this morning:<br/><br/>Bullet-time:<br/>As mentioned, bullet-time probably really didn't need extra dice being provided. More likely, bullet-time probably deserved a treatment somewhat like "Bringing Down the Pain": When a bullet-time card was played, there'd be a down-shift to smaller scale, but deadlier stakes. Going back to something Chris Peterson mentioned, I might make directly deadly stakes only available during a bullet-time sequence.<br/><br/>Defining where the action was taking place on a turn:<br/>There were several times during play where a scene/turn was started, then character minis from all over the board suddenly became involved. I'd thought that some rather general instructions to simply point out an area where the scene was taking place would be adequate to prevent that sort of thing, but I was badly mistaken.<br/><br/>In the future, I'd probably go with a mechanic I'd posited before that I simply didn't use. Specifically, I'd use a literal marker, probably a piece of yarn or string that would be used by the scene setting player to create a physical boundary to the location. This would then delineate the focus of the scene physically. Other characters could be brought into the action, but at some kind of cost or roll, or might simply be limited to lower value dice if they were outside of that boundary trying to impact events within that boundary.

I'm feeling chatty (obviously...)<br/><br/>What I can tell you right now aboout what Paul B and I have been talking about by way of e-mail is a concept along the lines of a <i>Build/Bring Your Own Braunstein </i>(BYOB), where folks show up with a variety of physical stuff, then build a game from some portion of that collection. We've also been talking about a method not unlike an R-Map for getting the game set up, by filling out certain kinds of questions for each character/faction.<br/><br/>Examples from Paul:\n<blockquote>Another simple answer might be to produce a worksheet for the GM/facilitator/host. Maybe it goes something like this:<br/><br/>Every character in the game has an entry in the worksheet.<br/><br/>Create 3 more characters than expected players. Unselected characters will be handled by the host (the more I use the word "host" the more I like it...makes it seem more like a party).<br/><br/>For each character, create the following:<br/><br/>* Is naturally allied with _______ (insert name/description of another character) because __________<br/><br/>* Is potentially allied with __________ because __________<br/><br/>* Is naturally opposed by __________ because __________<br/><br/>Each character is potentially opposed by *any* other character of course.<br/><br/>For each character, create the following:<br/><br/>* Primary objective (worth the most VPs)<br/><br/>* 2-3 secondary objectives (worth either VPs, or unlocks additional resources midgame, i.e. "read the tome in the church and gain +3 zombie miniatures")<br/><br/>For each objective, consider how *other* characters may relate to the objective.</blockquote>\nI tend to favor something similar, but with those sorts of questions broken out onto color-coded cards, one-color per faction, then shuffled and dealt out to everyone. each player then fills up some or all of those, and puts them back, facedown, in piles of each color, prior to players choosing/being assigned a faction. I'd also probably give some other "super powers" options on cards as well. The idea here being to create a collection of goals and abilities for each faction, without any one creating player knowing exactly what was in any given stack.<br/><br/>Notice that most of this discussion is centering around the creation of the game-scenario on the day of play, but doesn't delve to deeply into the other mechanics that might be used.<br/><br/>This stuff seems the most translatable between a B-Stein and a LARP to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209190/#Comment_209190" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T21:36:37+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  9:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Augh!

I think it'd be a good place to start any BYOB game: sketch out like...no fewer than three mutually incompatible groupings. I hesitate to call them "factions" because that sorta kinda implies organization. Although it sure could be! <br/><br/>Then, I'd create a single *secondary* objective that, by default, all members of that faction/grouping/whateva automatically receive. And the secondaries, to me, are the ones either worth a small VP hit, or an on-the-table effect upon completion.<br/><br/>Then, as the host (or in a more collaborative BYOB event, the players) start creating characters, designate which faction they belong to. Maybe a round-robin thing in a collaborative setting, where player 1 has the choice of all factions, player 2 has to pick one of the as-yet-unpicked, player 3 is stuck with the last one, then reset and player 4 has the pick of all three actions again. And so on.<br/><br/>I would also require that no fewer than two characters be generated for each faction. Otherwise you just have a bunch of independent characters, right? The whole point of creating a "faction" is to give groups of characters reasons to ally and/or fight. So, given IMO you need no fewer than 3 mutually incompatible factions, that means any given BYOB game will have no fewer than 6 characters.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209246/#Comment_209246" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T09:42:09+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  9:42AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only thing I see missing there is secrecy, Paul.

Having an outside host facilitates secrecy (although my deck(s) solution may get around that).<br/><br/><br/>Ah, gotcha. That was the reasoning behind my thought of shuffling the cards and dealing them randomly, then assembling the piles and choosing factions. You, the player, would always know what you'd written on the various cards in the different piles, but no one would ever no every card in a pile.<br/><br/>Still, there's a pretty valid reason for a neutral host, even without that stuff. The host can handle a whole bunch of other stuff that just plain makes play smooth.<br/><br/>Actually, my major concern is more about the amount of time taken up by that sort of thing, than an overall loss of secrecy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209499/#Comment_209499" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T01:06:00+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  1:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't followed all the neo-Braunstein design stuff, so I might be saying things you already know.<br/><br/>I think it was a very important/accidental ingredient of the original "Braunsteins" that there were a lot of players and only one referee (like 10:1, while you're at 2:1) and yet interactions were mostly one-on-one. Wesely was mostly talking to one player at a time out of the room, so he couldn't know a lot of what was going on. Likewise each player saw only a slice of what was happening depending on who they talked to (and who told them the truth). Nobody saw the whole picture, and that control vacuum was the soil for crazy roleplaying hijinks.<br/><br/>In some ways Braunstein is the diametric opposite of a modern "consensus building" game where we all sit around the table and everyone listens when someone talks. It doesn't even compare to a contemporary wargame, because there even if players are making their decisions secretly or conspiring, everyone sees the results on as the miniatures move across the table.<br/><br/>In Braunstein no one sees the whole story. You might have no idea who was "winning" until afterwards. The fewer players you have, or the closer the ratio of GMs to players, the more you lose that aspect.<br/><br/>And I'm not saying it's a desirable thing. I think there's a reason games evolved the other way -- natural selection favors a shared experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209534/#Comment_209534" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T08:37:39+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  8:37AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2009 9:38AM by komradebob.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yes and also no.<br/><br/>This was a test run for me, so I specifically designed for a small number of people. I'd very much like to see wha would happen in a bigger group set up, since, besides the stuff you've mentioned, it favors more single-character per player stuff, which is where you start to see more characterization (something that didn't happen nearly as much as I would have liked).<br/><br/>I don't think there was a natural selection process at all towards a shared experience, though. I think that's ignoring the very real role that a marketable, physical product has on how the culture of gaming has developed and which ideas have gotten transmitted through time.<br/><br/>I mean, there's a reason folks knew the name Gary Gygax, but you'd get blank stares when you said Dave Arneson or Dave Wesley, or even Braunstein.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209688/#Comment_209688" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T19:49:53+00:00" title="May 30, 2009  7:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...And Karen has put up pictures for the minis fans out there:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindle/sets/72157618850297930/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindle/sets/72157618850297930/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
