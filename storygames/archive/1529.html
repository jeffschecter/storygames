                    Interesting this thread is not about two sessions into a single TMW game, rather it's about my two completed sessions and the games I have planned to come.<br/><br/>I ran two games in the past month.  Other than my wife these games had very different players with very different results.<br/><br/>The first one was my foray into the scenario and I took a lot of cues from various APs (including a really good on on RPG.net - sadly I fogot whose it was and I cannot access it right now to link it.  I mimic'd a lot of what that GM did with my own spin.<br/><br/>So I had four players:<br/><br/>One decided that he wanted to play a lyncanthope so one of his abilities was to turn into a wolf.<br/>Another character was a monk (based on the Ize Zumi from L5R) with a living dragon tattoo.<br/>Another was a woman that used poison needles<br/>and yet another could summon mists about her and wandered about with a death countanence<br/><br/>Some of the things that I did differently was that instead of the Tengu from the demo I used Pennangalan.  Thus the peasant's heads pulled away from their bodies and attacked the PCs with their entrails.<br/><br/>I had the mountain wolves (like those in mononoke) spoke to the lyncanthrope and he ran off with them.<br/><br/>I added a monk in a shrine to various houses.  I determined from the beginning that the Moutnain Witch was going to be one of the Player's inner self.  That changed as the game progressed however it was a neat starting point.<br/><br/>Finally (before getting to character based stuff) I added a sword to the game to great effect.  Two characters found it sticking out of some peasants body (puppets of some tree spirits).  When they all saw it I asked several players what it did and they gave their own ideas building on what other said.  In this case the sword started being something that can help the man/wolf to change since he could only do so when his friends were in trouble.  Then it became "can cure lynchanthopy" which finally changed during a duel with the man/wolf that it cured by being able to kill him.  <br/><br/>Try it out and let me know how it worked for you.<br/><br/>So my wife decided that she was all in white and decided that she considered herself dead.  She had her ritual knife for which she plannined on committing the act once she collected the reward and gave the money to her daimyo to pay for debts the daimyo's son incurred but she took the fall for.<br/><br/>Another player decided that she was so disgraced that she would use the money to leave Japan.  She had the unholy pact and finally (after stealing death girls dagger) handed the knife over to O-Yanma.  She felt so shitty about betraying her new friend that she decided to kill O-Yanma anyway.<br/><br/>O-Yanma took the knife and brought forth HIS daughter, that looked amazingly like Joanna's character (death girl).  They were brought together and the PC finally slit her own throat before her mirror image.  This completed a ritual that made Joanna's character a death's bride to rule by his side.  <br/><br/>Wolf/man had desperately in love.  It was with his lord's daughter.  I had O-Yanam be a skinchanger and had statues of all the local lords and ladies in the province.  The Mountain Witch could then look like anyone he wanted.  It turned out that Joanna's character was actually his true love but he didn't recognize her until later.  After she did her ritual suicide he then recognized her and he was to be her groom.<br/><br/>The monk was there to challenge and ulimately learn from the old monk and cared nothing about the Mountain Witch.<br/><br/>So Halina's character (the poisoner) took O-Yanma's head and was the only to wander down to the Lord's castle and collect the bounty, buy a ship and sail to some island where SHE becomes a local version of the Mountain Witch.  Joanna's character then replaces the Mountain Witch and inherits his castle along with her new husband.<br/><br/>The monk was here for the revenge and did have a duel however it was stopped when the women ran ahead.  Through some negotiation and roleplay everyone survived.<br/><br/>Halina so says she will return to mount another attack and finish the job!                </div>

                            The second game I ran was not as succesful.  It was run but it was a bit bumpier.<br/><br/>I went with critters and ideas of my own design which seemed to work out well.  I used animals instead of people or spirits.  I used many themes from the Moutain Witch supplement including a bunch of giant crabs with faces on their backs and some had human limbs.  <br/><br/>I had this O-yanma be a gaijin illusionist (he was half japanese).  So he appeared the players in a fire.  This was meant to be a means for negotiation and ferreting out some secrets.  However I screwed up my own plot by having it too late in the game.  It should have come much earlier in the scenario.<br/><br/>The big scene was the tea house.  I had a run down abandoned town at the base of the Mountain Witch's castle.  They got there at night and one of the characters heard something and went to investigate.  the group briefly intereactred with a few different people.  I made certain I prefaced conversations with hints that the lighting sources of the people never changed it's facing even when they turned or walked.  I noted that it was excessively dark and on occasion they would see shadowy branches in the periferals of a scene.  The people repeated themselves a lot and if they watched carefully they would often act out whole scenes again.  There was a monk in the center of the tea house (I used the restaurant from Kill Bill as my basis) playing a stronged instrument.  Two characters were attacked from behind making them slow and lethargic (poisoned).  Some PCs were clever enough to attempt to flank some of the people and they found they would get really skinny, sometimes disappearing entirely.  One of the PCs tried approaching a woman and came across a smooth curved glassy surface which he could feintly see his reflection in.  The woman shot up and away from him with blinding speed.<br/><br/>The deal:<br/>The town was overrun by giant spiders of varying size.  They could project scenes that they had seen on their shiny abdomens.  They replayed a wedding they had witnessed once and the monk was actually a blind man that came to play music for them.<br/><br/>This scene was cool and to great effect but it may have pulled the attention away from the characters.  next time I use this I should have it be people they know and scenes they are familiar with.<br/><br/>The fights with the giant spiders were still creepy <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I had the players skin crawling <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>They went to finally meet the Mountain Witch.  This time the character with Deserate love had gone ahead to meet her groom, the Mountain Witch himself.  One of the PCs would be collecting the money even though he had done what he had come to do, kill another PC.  I was still confused by the end as to who was who and so I had the gaijin mountain witch guess once.  When the PC told O-Yanma that he must have the wrong person he retorted with "You japanese all look the same!"<br/><br/>This was with a group less used to narrative games like this.  They did a great job but they had a harder time getting their secrets out early.  I tell everyone that the goal is that we all know what's going on with their characters by the 3/4 mark.  One player kept her fate secret until the bitter end even when she had opportunity to reveal.  At one time she said "Even though I was poisoned I am fine," apparently indicating that she was using narrative control of her Dark fate.  later she explained that she had a conversation with the Mountain Witch over her unholy pact.  We suggested that the next time she narrarate that conversation for everyone to see.                        </div>

Hey, you mean <i>Kwaidan</i>! I'm dying to get some feedback. How did you like the book? Was reading the book helpful to your playing or GM'ing? Did you find it difficult to incorporate the themes from the book into the game, or was it fairly intuitive?<br/><br/>Also, how long was your second game (both in hours and sessions)?<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>

                            Both games were single days.  The second game ran a little shorter.  It ran about 6 1/2 hours.  I found that my games ran just the right amount of time.  I say that because I could feel my players eager to march forward.  We had several developmental scenes and I gave them ample time to interact but I could see that their eye was on the prize so both groups were pleased with the game's duration.<br/><br/>I did mean <i>Kwaidan</i>.  I thought it was great.  To be honest most of the help was from inspiration as per the stories that I retold (The Story of Mimi-Nashi-Hoichi).  I had a lot of ideas for future games but I gleened several scenes based on this story alone.    I think it's a wealth of information both on ways to employ Japanese supernatural elements and the types of stories told.  Intuitive?  That's tough.  I don't think it's use is transparent (examples would have to be in the book for that to be the case).  I am happy to walk through my design process if anyone was interested.  However I think the material is strong enough to bring to the table more ideas about a culture that might otherwise be, well, foreign to many.  Sure we see Samurai, ninja and geisha in pop culture but to understand the nuances of the myths <i>Kwaiden</i> will be invaluable.                        </div>

<p>Don, this makes me happy to see. I'm glad you were able to take that inspiration and make it your own.</p>
<p>You should watch the movie made from Kwaidan, too. It's gorgeous.</p>
