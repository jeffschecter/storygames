I had understood that for a long time after WWII, everybody shut the hell up about it, and even today there are laws against publishing materials that show swastikas and the like.  It just seems unlikely that they'd go "hey, we're Germans, let's play Nazis!" the same way Brits and Americans might agree to portray their nations in WWII.<br/><br/>But these are all just vague notions on my part and could be entirely wrong, so I'm curious what Germans or folks closer to Germany might think.<br/><br/>I know it's tangentially topical to Story-Games, but it seemed like a venue where I might get a good answer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256309/#Comment_256309" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T09:08:53+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  9:08AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is my take, sitting about a hundred miles north of Germany:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of simulation are we talking here?

WW2 and the Nazis are crammed down German school children's throats at least every other year on the official lesson plan, from what I remember.  If anything, Germany is still way too hung up on its Nazi past and spends way too much time obsessing about it.  Now, it should remain a topic--Germans do have a responsibility to prevent Fascism from ever rearing its ugly head again--but the mythification of Nazism leads people to overlook other, related issues because they try to think that Nazism was unique and had nothing in common with, for example, anything the American colonists and their progeny ever did to Native Americans, Japanese citizens, or African Americans.<br><br>What's forbidden in Germany is the display of Nazi symbols <i>outside of artistic endeavors</i> and denying the Holocaust.<br><br>Now, Germans do play Axis and Allies, which requires someone to take on the side of the Nazis.  The same goes for Day of Defeat or other such games.  It's not a big no-no at all.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256333/#Comment_256333" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T11:55:38+00:00" title="February 12, 2010 11:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is like the touchiness of playing the American Civil War. Sure it was a 150 years ago but don't think for a minute that it's over. In Muncie Indiana where the game store KOTD is based on there are guys with Confederate flags on their cars right now (even though we fought for the Union!) Here in the US people I think hide the political motives of their present thinking behind the romance of "The Lost Cause". So here the problem is getting people to play the north rather than the south. <br><br>Wargames so seldom deal with tough moral choices. When I was a young gamer in the 70's the guys who loved playing the SS were the ones I wondered about the most. What was that all about? I thought it had to be more than the cool uniforms. <br><br>Speaking as a German American there is always that lurking feeling that we share the guilt of the world wars. I believe this to be true because of a knee jerk reaction I find myself having. "But my family came over in 1850. We couldn't be responcible." It sounds a lot like the line I say about my Southern ancestors "We didn't own slaves, we were too poor." <br><br>The effects of wars are long lasting because the political issues are not settled. Just read a couple of books about Oliver Cromwell and tell me that the issues of the English Civil War are over. I know which side I'd have favored.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256337/#Comment_256337" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T12:15:37+00:00" title="February 12, 2010 12:15PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite><cite>Posted By: edheil</cite>I had understood that for a long time after WWII, everybody shut the hell up about it</blockquote>\n<br/>What's forbidden in Germany is the display of Nazi symbols<i>outside of artistic endeavors</i>and denying the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Now, Germans do play Axis and Allies, which requires someone to take on the side of the Nazis.

I guess what I had heard was that the generation that participated in WWII shut the hell up about *their own experiences* in it.  I didn't know about the educational emphasis on it; thanks.  (I happen to agree with you about the unfortunate consequences of mythologizing Nazism into a cosmic principle of ultimate evil as opposed to one instance among others of great human evil...)<br/><br/>The game depicted in KODT seemed to be a strange combination of wargame and LARP.  Local LARPers, taking the part of soldiers from their country, played according to a set of (very tightly specified) LARP rules, and their play was re-interpreted in strategic terms to create the international wargame simulation (where the fate of a single soldier in the LARP corresponded to the fate of 1000 soldiers in the wargame).<br/><br/>The people playing the wargame were dressed as soldiers on the appropriate side, so you did have a bunch of Germans dressed as, and playing the part of, Nazi officers (though they broke character in order to discuss game moves).  That's what gave me pause.<br/><br/>The joke of it was that the Americans were strong-armed into playing by their "general," Nitro Ferguson, having signed up to play a game of Hackmaster and being bait-and-switched at the last minute; even as they played the LARP they didn't realize that the international wargame was going on and what they were doing had repercussions in games being played in 2 other countries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256367/#Comment_256367" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T14:06:30+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  2:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>Wasn't Return to Castle Wolfenstein censored in Germany?

So a lot of the games that get played in KODT wouldn't actually work.<br/><br/>This is probably a topic for a new thread, but I really love the stories of the idealized gamer-lives that the KODT characters lead. Gaming in all forms is totally central to their lives. But instead of being weird social pariahs, they exist in a community where everyone acts that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
