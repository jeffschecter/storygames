This was a mistake I was unfortunately making in my club and Ben was helping me with it. Ben said that he gives a spiel to players before they start gameing. I was very impressed by the spiel; here it is:<br/><br/>"These games can be great, but they only work because of what each of us brings to the table. Your contribution is vital to making the game work...<br/>...But likewise, if there are four people in the game, each of us are only a quarter of the group, so it's also vital that we listen to what everyone else brings to the game and work with their contributions. We're each a minority, so we may not get everything we want, but if we compromise and work together, we can make something together we all enjoy, something that may surprise us more than something we would have made by ourselves. If we don't do that, if we refuse to work together, these games can suck. You will have a terrible time."<br/><br/>On the Story Games Seattle FAQ, <i><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/34448672" rel="nofollow">here</a></i>, (Ben's SG gaming club), it also says:<br/><br/>"But I'm not very creative!...<br/>...You might surprise yourself once you sit down and play. But either way <b>it's not about impressing each other with amazing ideas, it's about playing well together</b> and building on what what other people contribute."<br/><br/><b>So my question is: What is "playing well" in a collaborative Story Game?</b><br/><br/>I think Ben gave some really great answers above in regards to what it means to "play well." Is there anything you would like to add?

Ben does this nicely in the quote above, reframing "I'm trying to be creative to impress people" (a possible attitude a player might bring to the game) as "other people are creating content; my job is to support what they're trying to do".<br/><br/>I've had a number of great conversations about this with a friend who is *very* conscious about this in his gaming. He likes to take motifs, themes, and aspects of other peoples' characters and use those to create material, whether he is GMing or not.<br/><br/>A simple example is:<br/><br/>A player creates a character who is a knight in shining armour - a real Hero, a person who is a paragon of Goodness. <br/><br/>What do we with that character? Well, such a character is not complete without a counterpart - some clear evil to fight, something to stand in opposition to. So, in this case, my friend would likely move to create such an evil. Likely, this evil force would be framed in specific relation to the Hero's values. In the most obvious example, if the Hero were all about protecting the weak, the evil force might be a great enslaver of the helpless.<br/><br/>(Of course, if the game were more nuanced this wouldn't have to be such an obvious counterpoint. The next-most-obvious counterpoint, for instance, would be a character who thinks of herself as good, but, in fact, goes so far in "protecting the weak" that she ends up doing evil. And so forth; with each level of inversion or remove, we lose clarity but gain a potential for greater nuance.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459322/#Comment_459322" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-16T15:50:46+00:00" title="January 16, 2017  3:50PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> piece of advice is to always listen more than you talk.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_459327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459327/#Comment_459327" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-16T17:20:10+00:00" title="January 16, 2017  5:20PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After respect?

There's probably a fancy theory term for disruptive worldbuilding (if there isn't, I'm coining it now!) where a player keeps introducing new, complex, independent elements that are not strongly attached to the stuff previously introduced. Constructive worldbuilding takes elements already introduced and makes them work together, adding new stuff when some narrative glue is needed. You don't need to use every stupid thing, but try to use stuff introduced by other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459368/#Comment_459368" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T18:49:21+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  6:49PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2017 6:50PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that looking at some of the concepts in improv theatre is really helpful for story gaming.<br/><br/>For example, the idea of reincorporation, and building on what has come before (as Upstart discusses, just above me), is a powerful one.<br/><br/>Another powerful one is the maxim to "Be Obvious".

For functional roleplaying/story gaming, a person needs to learn to occupy the middle space: to make contributions to play which always demand response from others - ideas which are incomplete, and require another to "fill in" the gaps.

It's important to recognize that your first idea could be a good idea, but it's also important to recognize that it could be a bad idea, or there could be a better idea, and take a moment or a minute to consider alternatives. It's definitely important not to get hung up on the perfect contribution, but it's also important to give yourself some (anxiety-free) time to think, when that seems worth doing.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459385/#Comment_459385" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-18T10:56:29+00:00" title="January 18, 2017 10:56AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great point, IceCreamEmperor.

Might that may be a symptom of your going through a time when you're "taking Internet discussions and game way too seriously" yourself? You sure come out as very passionate sometimes on this forum - so passionate, in fact, it feels hard sometimes to challenge your opinions unless I'm putting just as much fire into it as you do, and it feels "safer" to disengage instead. I know I've often been guilty of the same, in a number of companies, and that's why I feel like speaking up about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459481/#Comment_459481" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-21T22:22:55+00:00" title="January 21, 2017 10:22PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2017 10:23PM by Stephen P.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So how would you mechanically implement Jason's advice?</blockquote>\nYou don't need to--it's social advice, and good advice at that.

Because despite what anyone might tell you, there's literally nothing at stake in this hobby beyond a group of friends having fun. <i>NOTHING</i>! And no evidence that gaming has ever had any meaningful effect on political policy beyond being the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Boogeyman&amp;Mode=like">#Boogeyman</a> from time to time.<br/><br/>Yet it's Internet Fucking Vietnam out there. You can't joke about <i>anything</i>, and the personal is political whether you like it or not. You have no control over the message you work conveys, even if you literally tell people what it means. And there's this expectation you can please whole groups, which means failing to do so is a deliberate choice. But it's impossible to please everyone on that scale, and even rape survivors are divided on whether making fun of rape is cathartic or traumatizing.<br/><br/>How can you collaborate in an environment like that?\n<blockquote>You sure come out as very passionate sometimes on this forum - so passionate, in fact, it feels hard sometimes to challenge your opinions unless I'm putting just as much fire into it as you do, and it feels "safer" to disengage instead.</blockquote>\nIf my speaking implies silencing others then it truly is a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ZeroSum&amp;Mode=like">#ZeroSum</a> game. Because I <i>need</i> passionate, challenging, and considered discussion. Also sarcasm. And if passion is what's shutting people down, then we might want to reevaluate the values of our forum culture, and maybe whether that culture should be a thing at all.<br/><br/>I may hold <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Individuals&amp;Mode=like">#Individuals</a> accountable for their actions rather than groups, but I've never threatened anyone with rape, doxxing, getting fired, or even made an <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23AdHominem&amp;Mode=like">#AdHominem</a> attack, and I call people on those every time I see them (do a search). I read <i>every</i> post and consider my words carefully, sometimes for days, typically making 9 drafts and hitting at least two websites in research (which I've now been slammed for both here and rpg.net). I treat everyone equally, and do not expect special treatment from anyone, or consider my own suffering and oppression more legitimate.<br/><br/>And I'm not saying that to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23VirtueSignal&amp;Mode=like">#VirtueSignal</a>, only to establish my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ModusOperandi&amp;Mode=like">#ModusOperandi</a>, which does not make me better than anyone else.<br/><br/>And what's actually at stake here? I mean I hate bad design, but when it comes to tabletop RPGs the worst it can be is frustrating. In computing it costs me time and money. In medicine it costs my health, vision, and hearing. In politics it costs my ability to associate and speak freely. But if we're saying these bad ideas should be stopped at the root, like many RPG activists seem to be, then isn't my passion justified?\n<blockquote>it's a general principle used to guide and orient behavior, and this one happens to be a very good principle indeed, both in roleplaying and in life.</blockquote>\nWhich is fine as long as you're only using it to guide and orient your own behavior, but beyond that this kind of motivational poster wisdom is all too easy to use as a tool of oppression.\n<blockquote>Uh, talk less.
