I'll try to be direct and to the point.<br/><br/>This is a very low-investment, casual game. You start playing as soon as you pick it up and begin reading. To read the entire product from cover to cover takes about as long as reading a wordy comic book (say on the order of something Matt Fraction or Joss Whedon might whip up, those guys can get a little verbose). When you're done with all that you've got the first half of a very stylish mystery story, and all the bits and pieces of the conclusion. You can then either examine the pieces yourself and try to figure out the ending (there's no right answer, you'll find whatever you go out looking for), or you work with a friend and come up with a story together. This cooperation part takes roughly 45 min, has a simple structure, and is very much akin to brainstorming a movie script. <br/><br/>\u2022 You can play this with someone who's never played a role playing game. <br/><br/>\u2022 You can play this with someone who doesn't like or has no interest in role playing games.<br/><br/>\u2022 You can give this to someone who doesn't know what a role playing game is and they will understand what to do with it and enjoy it. It's that simple, it's that direct. <br/><br/>\u2022 You can play it alone on an airplane, or a bus, or in a cafe.<br/><br/>\u2022 You can play it again 3-4 times without ever repeating yourself (and you'll be able to download some extras that increase this replay-ability even more in the very near future)<br/><br/>It's sexy, mysterious, obtuse, stylish, and cheap (only $13).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161432/#Comment_161432" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T09:43:24+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  9:43AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was incredibly intrigued by this last year (and by the way, you totally had the best marketing campaign for a game at Gen Con, what with the Missing posters plastered all over downtown Indy), even more so by the description of what the game is. I'll be dropping by the booth to take a look at this and quite probably buy it. The idea of the physical artifact and the interactive fiction element both appeal to me a lot.

Can't resist an attractive link!<br/>It looks interesting.<br/><br/>I have one question... is the reason you can play it with someone who has never played a role-playing game or who has no interest in role-playing games because it <i>isn't actually a role-playing game</i>?<br/><br/>Hmmm... that might be a bad way to say that.  I don't want to bring up the old, unending "What is a role-playing game, really?" argument, cuz it's stupid.  <i>Sweet Agatha</i> sounds really nifty and I love the idea of it, but ummm... well, let me ask the question this way: Would <b>you</b> describe it as a role-playing game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161480/#Comment_161480" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T12:07:20+00:00" title="August  8, 2008 12:07PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2008 12:52PM by Moreno R..">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>or you work with a friend and come up with a story together.

Scream it out loud, like you mean it!<br/>As an added bonus, not only is "collaborative interactive literature" more accurate it's also more snooty and intellectual-sounding!  I'm totally going to have to get this and shove it in the hands of one of my favorite former professors and say, "Check this thing out, dude.  It's collaborative interactive literature!"  For my non English professor friends I'll just say, "Hey.  This is a cool game.  Let's play it."<br/><br/>But I was wrong about what the important question is.  Whether or not it's a role-playing game?  Who cares about <i>that</i> anymore?  That was so this morning's issue.<br/>Now I just want to know whether I have to destroy something beautiful to save something I love or destroy something I love to save something beautiful.
