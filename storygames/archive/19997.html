They've barelf scratched the surface of B4 The Lost City, they've cleared two of my own dungeons, they've had lots of city adventures (I'm reading Hillfolk so I'm trying to up the drama) and now they've headed to JG The Caverns of Thracia (reskinned to fit al-Qadim).<br/><br/>I'll share two scenes. One is two consecutive jungle fights against first a band of al-Badia (a mix of humans and elves) and then a group of gnolls and jackalweres. We're playing completely "theatre of the mind" and everything I do or decide ruleswise is geared towards trying to get that to work. This time, it was a lot of hiding, circling around each other trying to find ambush positions, and using the new chase rules when spotted. One character was lulled to sleep by the jackalwere's gaze. At the end of this encounter, it became grindy as open combat ensued.<br/><br/>The second was way later, in a narrow corridor leading to a rope bridge over a deep chasm. The party spotted five giant bats. The module's text describes one thing that can drive the bats to anger and attack the party. I won't reveal what that is, but it definitely applied to the party. The bats attacked them and two of them were pushed down the chasm. Both fell unconscious (and were very close to being instakilled) and started rolling death saves while the one character who had made it back to the bridge started a grindy fight with the bats, switching between throwing darts and, when they darted in, slashing at them with a shortsword. One of the fallen characters unfartunately failed his death saves, after a promising beginning, and one succeeded but was unconscious for an hour more. The bat fight upstairs was grindy and not varied in tactics, but we decided to fight it out because the odds were against this poor mystic trying desperately to save his comrades. There were a few "If this d20 lands on a 13 or higher, you die" moments. In the end he prevailed. He went back and shortrested, he couldn't find a save spot so I rolled 6d6 -- six wandering monster checks since one hour had passed. All six came up threes! I roll these checks openly. Then he tied a rope on and climbed down to his pal. They shortrested again and I rolled again. Five fives, and one six. I rolled a party of [faction redacted, in case players read this], and gave a 55% chance to spot the dangling rope. They didn't, and moved on.<br/><br/>No-one asked for a time rewind this time, so we had the first PC death of the campaign.<br/>Afterwards, both of the fallen character's players remembered that they had been carrying immovable rods, a magic item that you can press to make immovable so that it, for example, stops you from falling. I had also forgotten that. We all laughed because that would've been awesome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442342/#Comment_442342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-01T08:45:14+00:00" title="February  1, 2015  8:45AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to mention that the PCs used caltrops to great effect in the jungle fight and that that was most likely the reason for their victory, since they were separated and being chased.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442351/#Comment_442351" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-01T20:03:57+00:00" title="February  1, 2015  8:03PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

Here, I'll paste it in from the Lost City thread:\n<blockquote>Quick recap of my current "seamless" rules:<br/>The golden, most important rule is that the action economy is maintained. Everyone gets one move, one action, one bonus action and one reaction per round. <br/>Everyone is ranked in dex order. That's the fall back, default order things happen in.<br/>In situations where it doesn't matter so much which order things happen in, I can jump around, leaving the turn order according to where the action is or where the engagement is, trying to be a bit more like DW (why I don't just give up and marry DW at this point is beyond me).<br/>In situations where it's very interesting and critical to see who goes first, I might have those participants roll dex for it but I've grown more reluctant to do so.</blockquote>\nIn the beginning, I hardly ever jumped around. Now I'm jumping around a lot, to the extent that I'm concerned that I'm messing up the action economy. Thinking of putting one of my many table sorobans to use for that (they're mostly for hitpoints).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442363/#Comment_442363" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-01T22:37:28+00:00" title="February  1, 2015 10:37PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I interpreted "full turn" as ten minutes, not sure if that's right or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442387/#Comment_442387" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-02T19:24:53+00:00" title="February  2, 2015  7:24PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!
