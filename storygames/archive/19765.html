Based upon availability of friends, their state of mental health ( I have several gamer friends who are cynically depressed or dealing with other RL issues that can render them unavailable) and my work schedule. Which frequently pulls me out of town for 2-3 weeks at a time pretty much every 3rd week of late. And the fact that many of my gamer friends are now in serious long term relationships which have pulled them out of the loop as far as impromptu gaming goes.<br/><br/>However, on average (even before things got as hectic as they are currently) we'd try to get together at least two times a month. If the stars align (and they did sometimes) we'd meet every week and on rare occasion 2 consecutive (usually Friday and Saturday) days a week. Though, I now consider it a good gaming month if we do our Apocalypse World game 1-2 times and the PbP  Monsterhearts game I'm in gets a single response from two of the 4 people involved in it once every 5 days. Not an ideal frequency for me but, unless I want to run every game and wrangle cats to get people all on the same page scheduling wise it's what I gotta live with. <br/><br/>I will note that among many of my circle of friends that the idea of running more PbP games has been a frequent topic of discussion of late. As it alleviates the problems of travel, scheduling and not everyone being "in the mood" at the same time. But it's something I've only recently become involved in and only dabbled a bit as far as the fundamentals of ruining a game goes. And I prefer face to face RP for it's instant gratification and feedback/social interaction.<br/><br/>Also, in the past when I was working out of town for months at a time we did do a game or two via Skype. Which worked out fine. As the rest of the group got together in person and I was tele-present off in the corner at the computer desk. The biggest hurdle there was access to a stable internet connection and a venue where we could RP without outside interruptions.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timon" title="Timon"><img alt="Timon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/653/nHCVEQVVO8HWF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timon">Timon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438467/#Comment_438467" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T16:08:40+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  4:08PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weekly, with 30-somethings and I am 52                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438473/#Comment_438473" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T17:09:14+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  5:09PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We try to adapt our gaming to fit the needs of parenting and job schedules, but growing older hasn't hurt our gaming at all.  My gaming life has been really excellent recently.<br/><br/>We run a weekly indie game night, wherein I GM a different one-shot of whatever I feel like running that week.  (This is about 50% published games, about 50% games I wrote for the occasion.)  For this game, kids are explicitly welcome.  My kids play with one or two other children from the other parents in the group.  They mostly keep each other entertained, so that we can get on with the roleplaying.  (Occasionally, we're interrupted or have to ask the kids to cut out the noise, but it works out.)  We tend to chat and eat pizza for a bit, get started late, run for about two hours and then wrap up.  We can't start much earlier (because people work day jobs) or end much later (because children have bed times), so we stick to simple, light, quick games.  This game winds up cancelled or just playing board games on one or two nights a month, but we try to have as much roleplaying as possible.<br/><br/>I'm playing in a Saturday night Fate game, with a different group.  None of that group has kids, but my wife is happy to watch the kids one night a week.  (I watch the kids full time the rest of the week.)  Being on a weekend, we can go a bit longer and later than we can on weeknight gaming nights.  This game was really reliable in scheduling and stuff, up until recently.  We've been on hiatus for a few weeks, but we're planning to resume shortly.<br/><br/>Then we also have an irregularly scheduled campaign of 13th Age.  Our one friend from out of town visits every week or two, and when he is around we try to find a time to play.  This game is ad hoc whenever we have some time and a quorum of players.  The children each have PCs in this game, and roleplay as much as they feel like.  (Sometimes they wander away and do other stuff.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438474/#Comment_438474" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T17:33:32+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  5:33PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm 42.

(At least, that's the case with the single/childless over-30 crowd; our friends with very young kids have had to focus their time on their families and drop out of regular gaming, understandably.)<br/><br/>I don't do any online gaming, both because I don't have a webcam or a decent microphone, and because I don't really get into socializing that way online. It's strange: I love going over to my friend's house on Saturday night every week to play a game, but for some reason the thought of committing to sitting down in front of my computer at the same time on a Tuesday night every week to play a game just leaves me cold.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438499/#Comment_438499" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T10:47:20+00:00" title="September 18, 2014 10:47AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            51 and my gaming of late has been purely play by post.

But I have been pulled into sporadic sessions a couple of times.<br/><br/>I have an online play-by-post game with the expectation of 5-15 minutes of play on a daily basis.

So many are now crafted for 2 hour drop-in sessions, or for campaigns designed to go 1-max in 10-20 sessions.

What's more we prefer campaigns to stretch 1-4 years. <br/><br/>Not that I object to having the option for condensed play, or shorter no-prep games...but designers also have to allow for the rest of us that like it old school (mostly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438557/#Comment_438557" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-19T15:15:20+00:00" title="September 19, 2014  3:15PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2014 3:15PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Honestly, a lot more of you folks are in weekly games than I expected.

Right now I'm not playing anything regularly, other than one-shots at a Story Games meetup, which is once per month. In the last year, though, I've probably played in one 4-session TSOY game and run another that went about 8 sessions. I've also run World of Dungeons a couple of times for my daughter.

We have occasionally had one player use google hangout to play, but we do prefer all in person.<br/>I'm running Call of Cthulhu (Masks of Nyarlathotep) roughly monthly, though sometimes every other month, face to face, though we did do character generation via google hangout. 7 people, 4 computers. Sucky -- but possible, which was amazing. Sessions are on weekends, 5-6 hours.<br/>I've been running playtests irregularly. Over the last year or so, I did a 3-4 session playtest of Dreamhounds of Paris, a 3-4 session playtest of Bubblegumshoe, a one off playtest of Feng Shui 2nd edition, and, currently, I'm running roughly a weekly playtest of Dresden Accelerated, 3rd session scheduled for Monday. These have all been in the evening, so 2-4 hours, depending.<br/><br/>This does not include gaming conventions. We skipped GenCon on account of it conflicted with LonCon3, but did play in a friend's weekly Laundry RPG. We've done Dreamation, Maelstrom, and DexCon this year. We're planning on Metatopia and need to figure out whether we're doing AnonyCon, as if we are, I should offer to run something.<br/><br/>Whoops, forgot larps. We've been to Intercon, the all larping convention. I was in a larp at Dreamation and one at DexCon. We were in two privately run 4-hour larps, Dreams of Ice and Ash, and Masks, both of which are variants of the Dance and the Dawn larp. In theory, we're tweaking Preque Vue for next year's Intercon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438596/#Comment_438596" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-21T06:56:23+00:00" title="September 21, 2014  6:56AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doing great! 40 here, unmarried, no kids (pets only). <br/><br/>Bi-weekly Google hangout game.

Since then, I've gradually got to the point where I almost have too much :-)<br/><br/>I'm in what breaks down to three regular groups, with a current fourth group for a mini-campaign.<br/><br/>I just finished a ~15 month run of <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i>. Prior to that I ran a Pathfinder game for roughly the same amount of time, and also played in a run of <i>Carrion Crown</i>.<br/><br/>Those three were with my regular group, which maintains the core three people while adding and losing others. We try to play roughly every three weeks (when I'm GMing, that's how I schedule it, with a quorum of 3 players.) Currently that group is doing a 13th Age "longshot" (the GM, who played Charleston in my Masks game, didn't want to call it a campaign but after the third "oneshot" session we compromised on that title.)<br/><br/>I'm in Lisa's EL campaign and was in her Bubblegumshoe playtest; I ran the Dreamhounds playtest as well (&amp; she dropped by for a few sessions.) I also was in one of the Dance &amp; Dawn LARPS (I not only danced with Lisa, but fought a duel with her as well.) With two of the players from that group, I'm in a Dresden Files FAE playtest currently. That's group <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>Group <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is the Tuesday night RPG meetup the New York SF/Fantasy meetup runs; I've helped turn it into a hippiesh group of * World and Fate players :-) I ran a Dungeon World game there, Star Wars FAE, a bunch of Risus one-shots, Lady Blackbird, the Dreamhounds playtest...and stuff. It's an interesting GMing environment--sessions are pretty short, so you have to learn a "speed chess" approach which does wonders for your pacing ability.<br/><br/>Group <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> I assembled for a Cortex Plus Drama project set in Whitechapel during the Autumn of Terror; if it works out well, I'll probably run it again with a different group. <br/><br/>It helps that I don't live with anyone, work from home, and have only cats as my dependents, of course :-)<br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438623/#Comment_438623" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-23T14:50:46+00:00" title="September 23, 2014  2:50PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking from my personal experience, I'm really appreciating the trend towards few-shot or short campaign games.

Kind of the opposite of what gaming was like as a school-kid/teenager (almost 20 years ago, scary thought), where we treated gaming like pizza: "Hey, we're not really feeling into it, but it's better to play *something* than not to play at all, right?"<br/><br/>It has meant that most of my games have been one-shots or series of 2-3 sessions. Last year, I played a two-session arc of Monsterhearts with two different groups, and each game is technically "ongoing", but the third session has been on hold for over six months now with both groups.<br/><br/>I've also played a few online games (B/X D&amp;D over IRC, with Eero and crew, as documented here on the forum), and a few over Skype/Hangouts (a Monsterhearts playtest, Apocalypse World, In a Wicked Age...).
