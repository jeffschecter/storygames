The details on each program can be found on the associated links located on:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.guildofblades.com/pod.php<br/>\n<br/>\nA generally summary of each plan:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Dropship.<br/>\nAnyone that uses our POD printing services can opt to leave some or all of a print run with us to be warehouses. You pay an extra fee for each item stored (varies by item type). This fee covers final assembly (we'll box and shrink your card games, for instance), warehousing and pick and pack for boxing and mailing shipments. You establish a small shipping fund, then you send us orders to ship products to wherever you wish them shipped (and we can print and include invoices where desired as well). Your shipping fees are deducted from your shipping fund and your on hand quantity updated. You'll have an online account where you can login to check your Dropship stock levels and current shipping fund balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Retail Program.<br/>\nWe're going to offer to represent the products we POD print through our existing retail venues. For the moment that will include our e-commerce sites and our Retailer Dropship program. A bit later this year, that will also include our B&amp;M retail store, with hopefully additional stores to sell through in the future. We'll print extra units of your game at our own cost to merchandise our sales venues. When your product sells, you get a cut of MSRP. If you are a POD client of ours, you would get 35% of MSRP for said sales. If you are not a POD client, you would get 30%. If you enroll in our Retail Program you will be given an online account where you can check your sales, account balance, and be given an accounting of which sales venues your sales happen through. We will also be considered enrollment of non POD printed merchandise that people wish to submit to us on a case by case basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Wholesale Program.<br/>\nThe Guild of Blades Retail Group will be venturing into the game distribution business. In essence, the Guild of Blades Publishing Group already does this with direct sales to retailers. We'll take your POD product that we print for you and add it to our wholesale catalog. Your product will be printed on-demand to fill orders for your product to our retail accounts. The great thing about this is, the savings involved with this program will allow us to offer your POD printed merchandise to retailers at traditional discount levels that retailers are accustom to receiving. Like with our Retail Program, you will have an online account where you can login to check sales activity and accounting of "where" your product was sold to. For each wholesale sale of your product, we pay you 20% of MSRP. The cost savings on this program should allow POD printed products that due to POD cost structures are often not fiscally viable to sell at wholesale discounts or are sold to retailers at less than traditional discounts, making it much more difficult to earn shelf space in B&amp;M stores.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere GOB Retail stands at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've got all of our new machines on order. When they all arrive, we're going to take a couple days to test them to make sure they are up to the quality we expect and good to go for production. All in all, estimated time to start our POD service is now about 2 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe continue to plug away at getting the Retail Group's web pages more complete and we are fervently working on developing the IT backbone for the Retail Group's business. When we are done, we expect our Dropship, Retail and Wholesale clients to have access to live data, as should our retail clients and the manufacturers we represent at wholesale. We fully intend to bring a level of data transparency to the fold that is sorely lacking elsewhere. Manufacturers will be able to see live data of warehouse stock levels and retailers will be able to order a product with confidence seeing that it is in stock, or a POD production with a 100% availability guarantee. Manufacturers will get to see WHO their products are sold to so they can more ably judge where to commit their retail support partnership and marketing dollars and where they need to give their products that "extra push".<br/>\n<br/>\nAs these things go, naturally, all of this is going to take some time to develop fully. But the ultimate goal here is more transparency of data for all of our clients. Since the time the Guild entered the hobby game market, we have seen a great many "assumptions" about the nature of the business, many based on little more than industry folk tale, and many a business charted a course with little viable data to base assumptions on. We're still a small player in the grand scheme of things, but the Guild of Blades Retail Group will strive to bring a little clarity to our little corner of the pond.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore updates as things progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a final note: As a company that will soon be filling the shoes of a game manufacturer, POD printer, retailer and distributor, what have we missed? What services haven't we thought of that could be a value add to either or both of independent game manufacturers and retailers? We're open to all ideas, even if they seem insane on the surface. You never know what we might be able to make work. We're at the ground breaking stages here, so now is the time to pipe in with your dream wish lists...<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Good luck with that.<br/><br/>What I'd do is, as you get clients for your POD services (and you complete their transactions), please encourage them to chime up here or on RPGNet or wherever with their experience. Another beautiful POD flower in the field is a good thing for everyone.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
