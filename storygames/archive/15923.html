Except I had a horribly punishing week at work, and didn't get to put in as much game prep as I wanted. I have, like, a half-finished adventure, and no time to finish it.<br/><br/>So. I have a lot of cool monsters statted up and a town pretty well fleshed out and a bunch of ideas, but I feel like the overall setting/theme/backstory is vague and will confuse the players. <br/><br/>Here's what I have so far.\n<ul>\n<li>The adventure is a mix of lots of stuff: social interactions, foreshadowing, figuring stuff out, fighting monsters, going into a dungeon. Serious old-school, not wacky, gonzo old-school.</li>\n<li>The PCs go to a little town way up north where terrible winter storms are causing trouble. Magical, scary storms, with ice and wraiths and winter wolves. They run into some of this on the way there, like, 5 minutes after we sit down to play.</li>\n<li>The people in the town are all scared. They know that the storms are caused by Winter's King, a fierce-but-not-evil winter spirit / faerie lord kind of guy. He is pissed, for some reason. Not sure why.</li>\n<li>An evil wizard came through town a couple years back, asking lots of questions about Winter's King, and the faeries that live in the Old Forest.</li>\n<li>The PCs have to venture into the Old Forest, filled with wily, indifferent faeries and dangerous animals. Maybe they meet a nice-ish faerie, who tells them some useful shit?</li>\n<li>The PCs have to cross through a big, ancient field where a great war was once fought, a "barrow downs" kind of place. This place is lousy with undead - ghosts, wights, wraiths. </li>\n<li>There is a dungeon, underground, with traps and animated statues and such. Maybe the evil wizard summoned and bound Winter's King? Maybe the evil wizard did something else?</li>\n</ul>\n<b>PLEASE ADVISE.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362109/#Comment_362109" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T22:15:11+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 10:15PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll start with this: work vs. prep suuuucks.

They see the light of a lone cabin by the lake (or river, or whatever). As they approach, they hear slapping sounds and cries. Through the windows, they see a burly man with black hair and a droopy mustache crawling on the floor, wearing only his suspenders and britches and looking like he is all wet. Another man, with long blond hair and a full beard is whipping the first man with a belt while that man crawls around.<br/><br/>If the PCs enter the cabin they will discover that the black-haired man, Boris, fell into the lake and was rescued by the blond man, Kolya, who is whipping him with a belt to get his circulation going again. They have a bottle of vodka to keep themselves warm, and they have a handful of dragon's teeth they found in a field that they have been trading with a local faerie, Stukla, for faerie-silk garments that they sell to travelling merchants. They have some gold saved up so they can give their dear friend Milan a decent burial, because Milan is presently buried in an unmarked grave under a tree next to the big, ancient field where the undead lurk. Boris and Kolya know which tree he lies under, but are too scared to go there, because of the undead.<br/><br/>If the PCs agree to retrieve Milan's body, the pair will gladly give them half their gold, and spend the rest on a funeral.<br/><br/>Or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362122/#Comment_362122" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T22:31:31+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 10:31PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stukla is a short little gnome or redcap who wears greens and browns and a bright red cap.

That sounds good.<br/><br/>So who is the king of the faeries now? Is it Marbright, the dandified pretender? He has the evil wizard's help, though he pretends to be opposed to him, because the other faeries don't like him. But the king of winter's daughter, Hallafina, sees herself as the rightful heir, now that her father has been defeated.<br/><br/>If the PCs expose Marbright's deception, the other faeries turn against him. Hallafina (once crowned Queen of Winter) or some other faerie might offer them a boon, but Marbright, in exile, will probably become a recurring villain. If the PCs free winter's king, Marbright will flee in terror, but Hallafina will continue to press her claim to the throne of winter, because her father was defeated by the evil wizard, so he must abdicate. If the PCs are on the winning side, they will probably be granted a boon.<br/><br/>Maybe the boon that comes from being blessed by the king or queen of winter is: When you travel through the Northern Winter (what, you didn't think it was the throne of winters <i>everywhere</i>, did you?), roll+cha. On a 10+, you travel through a picturesque landscape of glistening crystals and downy snow that thoroughly impresses anyone travelling with you that you are trying to seduce or whatever. On a 7-9, the winter seems less strong to you, and you... I can't remember the DW travel move. You eat half as many rations or whatever the fuck it was going to cost you to make the trip. On a miss, the throne of winter isn't watching over you at this particular time! But one of your enemies amongst the winter faeries is! Or the spirits of winter are especially hard on you because no one is looking (and will be duly punished later). The up-shot is that you can take a +1 to your next roll against the throne of winter because whomever it is feels bad about this oversight.<br/><br/>Or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362253/#Comment_362253" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T05:23:10+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  5:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 5:23AM by Brian_Minter.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the advices!

Take notes about them, a paragraph each, maybe sketch a little doodle map. They're your cues for improvising/describing stuff in game.<br/><br/>Then make sure the players/characters have a reason to visit those places, especially the dungeon. Maybe even prenegotiate before the game, or open with a leading question "So, what did you hear was in there, that made you make this journey?"<br/><br/>Don't worry about the backstory, as long as you know what's causing these events and so on it's fine. Just pick something and go with it, have a backbone, the rest is just floating ideas that you can bring in the game as needed. DW's moves like Spout Lore and Discern Realities (Are they still called that?) will help you deliver the info to your players in a reliable fashion.<br/><br/>IMHO YMMV etc as usual                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362309/#Comment_362309" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T09:15:58+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:15AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 9:16AM by Brian_Minter.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advice, Gregor, thanks.

Somewhere along the way they got sucked into a drain in a brewing room and traveled into "Beervana".<br/><br/>If you really pay attention to character generation and make interesting things happen when you make hard moves, you really don't need prep. In fact, at least for one-or-two shots, I would say DW is better with LESS prep.<br/><br/>It's hard to let go, but the results can be very satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362383/#Comment_362383" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T11:34:26+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 11:34AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris,<br/><br/>Can you tell us a little more about *how* all those things came about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362384/#Comment_362384" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T11:36:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 11:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>1.

I described another narrow opening between the "Graves" and "Collapse". So one character tried climbing up on a headstone to look through the opening. Skeletons lying underneath the muddy graves reached up and attacked the party. The Wizard rolled a 7-9 on Cast a Spell, and chose "draw unwanted welcome" as the unfavorable outcome. So I described the magical missile flying from the wizard's hands and crushing the skull of the nearest skeleton. But the immense shrieking sound from the less-than-perfect spell was very close to the mating call of a giant purple worm, who started slithering out from treeline to meet his Match.com date.<br/><br/>After some negotiation (Parley) with the giant worm which included throwing the worm a chunk of skeleton that still had meat attached, the party made tracks to get into the ruins but quick. They figured, whatever was inside couldn't be as bad as what was outside.<br/><br/>I assumed there were a few goblins on watch in the Tower, but they were probably busy crapping themselves from the HUGE WORM trying to get through the collapsed entrance. Once the party hopped inside, they saw another goblin who had been roasting what looked like an Elvish hand on a stick over a fire. After all the hubbub, the goblin made a quick beeline for the interior of the ruins.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I was actually railroading a bit as I wanted to push the action to the interior of the ruins. But I did it with hard moves from bad dice rolls and reactions from scared/horny monsters. <br/><br/>I believe they split up at some point (the session was late last year so don't remember). In "Casks", they found and rescued the daughter of a local merchant (who was paying them to find her). One of the characters was immediately smitten with her. But the daughter was knocked unconscious by another character who opened the huge wooden door on her in a rush to warn the party about the impending goblin attack.<br/><br/>In "Clang", someone found a dwarf chained to a wall and forced to fix armor and weapons for the goblin bandits using a hammer and anvil and a small fire. The Fighter made (I think) a Hack n Slash roll and freed the dwarf, who wanted nothing to do with anyone in this place and ran into "Vat". I'm sure there was a failed Parley roll here somewhere. You'd think the dwarf would have been able to free himself, but go figure. <br/><br/>At this point, the Wizard had rolled 7-9 on another Magic Missile spell and picked the same outcome. Suddenly they could feel the whole area shaking (the ruins were built into the side of a hill) as the lovestruck giant worm was bashing itself against the entrance, Team Edward-style. The goblins in the towers ran by in the corridor between "Vat" and "Clang" to get away from the huge monster. One or two ran into "Clang" where most of the party was, and the characters dispatched them with some Hack n Slash.<br/><br/>Once things "quieted" down, the party (including the freed daughter) walked into "Vat" to see what happened with the dwarven smith, but he was gone! The "Drain" looked much too small, but the character with the low WIS figured it must be magic so he stuck his head in...and got sucked through the drain. The others shrugged their shoulders and followed.<br/><br/>End of session 1.<br/><br/>I"m sure I missed some "Spout Lore" and "Discern Realities". I really use those two to listen to what the players think are interesting, and move the story in that direction. It's a great tool.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362419/#Comment_362419" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T13:11:04+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  1:11PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It's obviously system agnostic and I don't detail any of the locations, so it is all setting and situation.

Just something to hang your hat on. D&amp;D Cliff Notes, if you will. Those one-word room descriptors are GREAT for me. <br/><br/>The bulk of it is listening very closely to what the players are describing their characters doing and what they think is going on. Again, Spout Lore and Discern Realities are a great way to let our players help build the dungeon as you move along. Also, paying attention to the strengths and weaknesses of each character and the inter-party relationships. Once I knew the Wizard wanted to fail spectacularly, I let him. <br/><br/>My input was less about imagination, and more about pushing hard in "some" direction. I feel like (esp in a one-shot), if the characters are sitting around discussing what to do, I'm not giving them enough to do. Breaks are breaks, but during the action I'm not shy about pushing my thumb down until it hurts a bit to keep things moving. I just find that players have more interesting reactions when they don't have too much time to think about the "perfect" solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362460/#Comment_362460" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:56:51+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>why are they going to this dangerous place to fight monsters</blockquote>\nBecause there's treasure there?<br/><br/>Or something else they want / need?<br/><br/>Or there's a sizable bounty on the monsters or clearing the lair?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362652/#Comment_362652" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T22:58:12+00:00" title="February 25, 2012 10:58PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finished up the game earlier tonight.
