And all the examples of Traits or things in my copy are Raises. Here are my questions:<br/><br/>1. Let's say my remaining dice are: 1, 2, 2. You Raise with a 5. I have a 2d10 Trait I'd like to bring into play, so I narrate accordingly.<br/><br/>But... do I narrate Taking the Blow (because I have low dice), even though I could roll a 10 and actually end up Reversing the Blow? How do I know what kind of See to narrate (Block/Dodge, Reverse, or Take the Blow) before I've rolled the dice? How can I narrate before I've rolled the dice, in this case?<br/><br/>2. This one actually applies to Raises AND Sees:<br/><br/>If I narrate a Raise or See, then roll more dice (because I'm bringing in a Trait, or escalating), and the dice really suck, have I committed to Raising or Seeing? Or can I Give now?<br/><br/>For example: We're talking, and I decide to punch you. I roll a bunch of dice, but they all roll really, really crappy. Can I Give now, "taking back" my own Raise? <br/><br/>What if you shoot me, and I want to See that, and I roll some Trait or Belonging, but the dice are really really bad. Am I committed to Taking the Blow (and risking death), or can I Give at this point, even after having rolled those dice?<br/><br/>3. Is there a limit to how many Traits, Belongings, and other dice you can roll in during any given Raise or See?<br/><br/>It seems like you can escalate (bringing in those dice) and instantly roll an appropriate Trait, as well as a relevant Belonging (like if you shoot someone with your Gun, and you have a Sharpshooter Trait). So that's [escalation dice] AND [Trait dice] AND [Belonging dice] in one "action". Is that right? <br/><br/>What about: Could you ever bring in two or more Traits during one roll/action? Or two or more Belongings?<br/><br/>Or is it always just a question of "does it make sense in the fiction"?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181539/#Comment_181539" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T11:20:47+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 11:20AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) first you say what you're doing that justifies the Trait being rolled in the first place.

For instance:<br>"I pull my Coat tighter about me..."<br>Roll dice<br>(Reverse) "...and its workmanship is cowing, sublime." (Raise) I say, 'You know what this coat means, and what the gun under it is used for when the coat is ignored!'"<br>(Block) "...and feel in its stitchwork the love of my family and kin and home." (Raise) ...<br/>(Take) "...but it's just a symbol, I realize--a symbol of an authority that's clearly not acknowledged here." (Raise) ...<br/><br/>The trick, I guess, is to invoke without characterizing the invocation until after the roll. My Coat gets me my dice, it doesn't get me a Reverse, Block, or Take, so I shouldn't narrate such until I push forward dice.<br/><br/>Works well enough, when you get used to it. Makes for some fun moments, as you try to scramble to narrate an unexpectedly bad (or good) die result.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181551/#Comment_181551" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T11:47:41+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 11:47AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2008 11:49AM by J_Walton.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my play experience, we often do something similar to David, but sometimes we do something a bit different, which oddly enough drifts Dogs to look more like a traditional resolution system.<br/><br/>If I'm like, "Sweet, I totally whip out my big freaking gun and point it at his head, stopping him dead in his tracks." (roll 2d10, but, as you see, I've basically already declared what my See is going to be, assuming that I'm going to roll big).<br/><br/>And then, say I roll really low, like a 2 and a 3. Then, generally, the player in charge of my opponent or, really, anybody in the group says something like, "Ouch, I guess he's not that impressed with you and your boomstick.  Must be that quivering lip that betrays your uncertainty." (which, sneakily enough, basically declares my Taking The Blow for me, so I just need to push some dice forward).<br/><br/>All of that is to say: in practice, I often find that the explicit steps (Raise, See, Taking the Blow, etc.) break down or merge together as the group develops more and more fluency with them.  Often, as above, the person who ends up narrating them may not even be the player rolling and manipulating the dice in all cases (crazy!).  In any event, things become much less rigid and more naturally flowing, which shouldn't be a surprise.<br/><br/>In the beginning, though, it totally makes sense to stick to the kind of thing that Ralph and David are recommending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181564/#Comment_181564" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T12:50:33+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 12:50PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That helps very much, everyone, thank you!<br/><br/>And makes total sense.
