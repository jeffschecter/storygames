Or maybe it would be a mixed-use building and be a game-space coop as well as a FLGS.  This would be neat.<br/><br/>Then I got to thinking about discussions of gamer communes that I've been in and decided to search.  This has been <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1137" rel="nofollow">talked about before</a> around here.  What would it take to make you <i>actually</i> consider buying into such a thing?  Are finances the biggest deal?  Or the move?  Or what?  What would you expect to have to compromise on?  What would you not be willing to?<br/><br/>E.g. on that last bit, I wouldn't live in a building where people could smoke.  But I'm a vegetarian and am kind of squicked by meat -- but I wouldn't have a problem sharing a kitchen with (tidy) carnivores.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228471/#Comment_228471" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T13:16:53+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  1:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not feelin' it, what with all the living rooms around.

Not exactly what the thread is about, I know, but I've been to the venue and it's super-cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nStrip malls are emptying out all over America these days, as genius entrepreneurs around the nation discover that a deep recession is not the best time to open up the world's first All Jell-o Bistro, Porn-and-Yarn Store or Plastic Banjo Repair Shop. These places might provide a more cost-effective alternative for gamers who can't afford to throw in on a full mortgage each month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
