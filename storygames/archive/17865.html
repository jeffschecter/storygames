Perhaps the biggest let down are lore moves which are, for the most part, very dull and matter of fact. Given this takes place in a supernatural world of cosmic horror, Lore moves -- the thematic concept of which is made of awesome -- are totally lacking.<br/><br/>Has anyone put forth alternative ideas for Lore moves? I've looked through all the Tremulus threads here on SG already. (Also, I would totally bring over Graham W's Insane Moves from his own purist Lovecraft hack.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404347/#Comment_404347" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T18:40:55+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  6:40PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally in agreement with you: the Tremulous playbooks are uninspiring and the Lore moves are meh. Considering that the playbooks are more than 50% what *World hacks are about I was really disappointed with Tremulous. Personally, I think all the playbooks moves need to be rewritten, but yeah the Lore moves are especially meh considering that you must spend points to use them. One thought I had was Lore moves should be transformed into some sort of narrative driving move where players can create an important narrative object/scene/person out of whole cloth. For instance, the Antiquarian could have an important artifact in his collection.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404389/#Comment_404389" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T10:19:08+00:00" title="January 24, 2013 10:19AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One thought I had was Lore moves should be transformed into some sort of narrative driving move where players can create an important narrative object/scene/person out of whole cloth.

Now I know you get player-invented items &amp; info from moves like Poke Around but overall Tremulus seems to have missed the boat on the idea of players driving the narrative; there's a huge amount of GM authorship here and barely/rarely any opportunity for players to contribute.<br/><br/>Le sigh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404413/#Comment_404413" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T13:03:06+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  1:03PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 1:04PM by Colinaut.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poke Around allows only discovery minor items or major items that are up to the Keeper. I was envisioning Lore moves as allowing more drastic inclusions/changes to the narrative. <br/><br/>I think the problem with Tremulous is a distinct issue with gluing Lovecraftian style narratives to the type of narrative that *World style mechanics leans towards. Lovecraftian focus tends towards mundane characters caught up in something beyond their understanding. In AW, the characters in AW are unique badasses and larger than life, and all NPCs are put in crosshairs. In Lovecraft, anyone and everyone unfortunate enough to get caught up in the horrors and madness is put in the crosshairs including the characters. The authors of Tremulous dealt with this conflict by making the Playbooks more like simple stereotypes and all the player moves generally mundane. If you read the section on Advancement, it's assumed that most characters would just die or go mad and players would just grab another playbook. The playbooks are strongly deemphasized as characters are seen as disposable. It's also telling that the most innovative part of Tremulous is the Playsets, which makes the town and the horrors more richly detailed and important than the characters.<br/><br/>In order to deal with this conflict between Lovecraftian storytelling and the type *World leans towards, I think Tremulous needs a more profound shift either in the type of narrative or the mechanics. If you are determined to tell a story where the Characters are nothing more than ants to be stepped on by the elder gods, then the Playbooks should be drastically simplified where Stats are simplified and you get one unique Move and that's it, or gotten rid of completely (more in line with Cthulhu Dark or Dread). If you are determined to use Playbooks the way AW does, then the Characters deserve to be more badasses with more interesting moves and more ability to affect the narrative and win the day (but not without a cost of course).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404432/#Comment_404432" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T14:38:42+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  2:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just one note. There are plenty of AW hacks where the PCs are not particularly special (World of Dungeons, Murderous Ghosts, etc). I don't think that's necessarily critical to the mechanics at all. I do think that Tremulous needed very different core moves if it was really going to be successful, though. There's no reason you can't do Lovecraft well with a AW hack, but it probably needs more hacking on the PC side of things than Tremulous attempted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404434/#Comment_404434" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T14:41:10+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  2:41PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             Wouldn't that be something: a horror themed AW hack where the player moves were front move like one liners, and the players only rolled the dice when a monster's attack told them to....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404453/#Comment_404453" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T15:46:08+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  3:46PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that.

Is it just AW with a couple of different terminology uses? That would be disappointing, and probably the source of the grumbling on SG when the game suddenly went public and we had no idea anyone was developing it, which is pretty much the opposite of how AW hacks usually go down (and they're inevitably better for it).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404463/#Comment_404463" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T17:07:54+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  5:07PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just provoking you into doing something better, Johnstone.
