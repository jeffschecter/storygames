At least, that's what we think.<br/><br/>My players are really digging the "Battles which are not really battles, but for which the metaphor of battle works very well".<br/><br/>The only problem we're having is this:<br/><br/>The rules say quite simply that characters taking "wounds" in a non-combat, non-physical still takes wounds.  Which is fine, I can totally dig why a severe knock to a hero's ego in an argument fucks their shit right up.  The problem comes when they try to remove that wound and still use healing to do so, which kinda breaks the fiction of the thing.<br/><br/>So we came up with two solutions to this, and I was wondering if anyone else has tried or thought about things like this.  The first is just to have players heal "spiritual wounds" with different attributes.  So using, say, Orate or Music instead of Healing.  The only problem there might be that this makes those attributes a bit too powerful perhaps?<br/><br/>The other option is to have those injuries convert into impairments, which are then dealt with in the usual way.<br/><br/>Anyone tried either of those or got any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78729/#Comment_78729" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T10:08:15+00:00" title="June 29, 2007 10:08AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2007 10:08AM by Ludanto.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My little thought is that you can simply broaden your idea of "healing" to include "spiritual" healing, via counseling and the like.  If you can get your head around "non-combat wounds", then why not, "non-physical healing".  As a matter of fact, there's nothing I've found in the book that describes Heal as being anything other than a skill for removing the meta-game element known as "wounds".  That's all I've got.  I have no insight into alternate attributes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78836/#Comment_78836" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T17:34:51+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  5:34PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would seem like an easy rules hack if you wanted to experiment with "realms of harm", each with its own healing skill.  So you might say that the realms of harm are physical, spirit (composure) and social.  When a wound is received, mark the would box with a letter to indicate the type of harm.  Each realm will have its own healing skill, for example Heal for physical, Music for composure, and Orate for social.  Then when healing, the healing contest removes the highest wound of the type appropriate to the skill being used, plus one OF THE SAME TYPE for each additional victory.<br/><br/>So for example if character's wound track was filled as follows: S C C P<br/><br/>And another character sang him a soothing song, and gained an extra victory, the wound track would now be S [ ] [ ] P<br/><br/>(where [ ] means empty box).<br/><br/>Hey, let me us know if you try something like this, and if it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78881/#Comment_78881" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T01:31:48+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  1:31AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rich,<br/><br/>I'm glad you're enjoying the game. Non-combat battles are totally fun.<br/><br/>I see what you mean about Healing. Personally, I'd probably go the route suggested by Jason, and let the application of the Healing skill be very broadly interpreted in the game fiction. That will maintain the oomph of the skill relative to other abilities.<br/><br/>Having said that, Wil's Agon-fu is mighty and his idea sounds workable to me. So you've got your pick of two good approaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
