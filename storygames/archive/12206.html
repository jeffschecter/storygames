We talk about the role of Fate, strengths and weaknesses of the minigames, and the rules text. We mention a lot of frustrations and criticism we had Diaspora this episode. However, this is not a negative review. We all really liked Diaspora, but it is not without its flaws. Don't let that stop you from playing it though.

I felt that your collective analysis came to some interesting conclusions this time.  I'm definitely looking forward to the social combat chapter now (I'm about halfway through the book).  One of the concerns I have about Diaspora and FATE in general is how much of a tendency there is to play to the system as opposed to being engaged in what the characters are doing in the game.  It sounds like this might be the case to some degree.  Although as I was listening to your critique of the mini-game, I wondered if because you are approaching these games with the goal of analysis, you might be much more aware of it and less concerned with the story and setting.  <br><br>Jesse, in the beginning, you complain that when your FATE points run out, you feel like you have no way to express what is special about your character.  What about your skills?  Doesn't the value hierarchy of the pyramid not make the skills that your PC is good also a defining part of their character?  Or were you referring specifically to the mini-games where perhaps skills don't come into play?<br><br>Again, great work all around.  You really added something to my understanding of Diaspora.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273761/#Comment_273761" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-31T20:14:01+00:00" title="May 31, 2010  8:14PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2010 8:25PM by Jesse.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite> What about your skills?  Doesn't the value hierarchy of the pyramid not make the skills that your PC is good also a defining part of their character?</blockquote>\nThis is an EXCELLENT question.<br><br>Here's the short answer: No.<br><br>The why of that answer is kind of subtle.  Let me see if I can articulate it.  I'm a very emotional player.  I like mechanics that help me express, communicate, and give weight and mechanical backing to my emotional investment.  A static +1 in Computers doesn't do that.  How I view the actions he takes with computers is fluid and changes with the *meaning* of those actions.  I want mechanics that back that investment.<br><br>It's probably easier to illustrate with a game that does work the way I like.  Imagine an apothecary who is mostly a scholar.  He's primarily a cerebral character and not much of fighter.  In a FATE game I might give him a Knife skill of +1 because he does have some daily experience with small blades and something like Scholarship +5 at the top of the pyramid.<br><br>Okay, now imagine that this simple apothecary discovers that the inn keeper's daughter whom he is fond of has been woo-ed away from him by one of the king's knights.  He's in a tavern and he over hears the knight bragging about bedding the girl.  So, if the apothecary is my character I might decide he goes into a rage, picks up a knife and stabs him.<br><br>There is so much more going on here more than just the Knight's trained Sword +5 vs. the apothecary's poorly trained Knife +1.  That's thinking only about the characters in terms their "reality" and not in terms of my relationship with them EITHER as an author OR an audience.  It litterly cuts me, Jesse, the real person out the equation in this moment.<br/><br/>Consider then that I was playing this apothecary in In A Wicked Age... Back at character creation much like I give him a Knife +1 in FATE I might give him With Violence a d4 because I don't really think of him a particularly violence oriented character.  But I do see him as very romantic so I give him a With Love at d12.  (Side Note: To keep this simple I'm going to ignore the fact that you choose TWO forms to roll in that game).<br/><br/>Okay, so now we go back to the example situation.  If my investment as an author and audience is in how desperate and perhaps a bit pathetic this attempt is I might go With Violence and pull out the d4.  If my investment on the other hand is full bore boiling rage and bloody vengeance I might go With Love and bust out the d12.<br/><br/>The point here is that in EITHER case I may succeed or fail but independent of outcome I feel like I was accurately represented *in that moment*.  What I was feeling was properly communicated and mechanically weighted.<br/><br/>This is another reason I really like Sorcerer.  I might build a character with a Stamina of 2 which doesn't make him much of a fighter.  And indeed people who play the game with the straight stats often find the game very frustrating because the results are incredibly uneven.  You have to understand the other dice tricks to make the game work.  <br/><br/>One of those dice tricks is the rather simple Bonus Dice mechanics that are not just vague "good role-playing" dice.  The book is VERY specific on the standard for which they are to be awarded.  There's up to five of them.  That means in *practical* actual play terms my Stamina 2 character actually has a fluid Stamina from 2 to 7.  With an average effective Stamina of about 4.  And that is literally dependent on how impassioned I express his Stamina based actions.<br/><br/>FATE lets me do this *so long as I have FATE points*.  I can express my emotional commitment via my Aspects.  But once the FATE points are gone it's like having your lawyer quit on you half way through the trial.  I literally feel like the game stops listening to me.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273763/#Comment_273763" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-31T20:53:06+00:00" title="May 31, 2010  8:53PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff as always Will! We especially appreciate your critical comments because until fairly recently <i>Diaspora</i> has received largely positive attention. While that's ego-stroking it's not all that useful as we go forward and make new games that we hope improve on <i>Diaspora</i>. Your criticisms are partially related to simple differences in play style -- we pretty much never run out of fate points, so clearly we're using them differently (I've observed this at some length on my blog), but others are deeper issues that are already part of what we're changing in <i>Soft Horizon</i> or why we're departing from FATE almost completely in <i>Hollowpoint</i>. Both are experimental games, whereas <i>Diaspora</i> is not so much -- it doesn't take any deep risks and, aiming at <i>Traveller</i>-style play, doesn't really have to.<br/><br/>Again, thanks for giving us the spotlight here. I'm hoping that <i>Diaspora</i> has been around long enough for more critical consideration now -- it seems like the early blush is hard to penetrate. Maybe people don't like to point out the negatives while there is a lot of positive peer pressure on the game. So now we're old enough we can take a couple of hits. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273789/#Comment_273789" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T08:40:23+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  8:40AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, very clear explanation.

I heard I was invoked!<br/><br/>Primarily, I see a flavour difference between Heinlein and Asimov, despite both of them being future fiction.   Heinlein has a very distinct pulp aspect to his space stories, especially his later works.  Men are men!  Women carry a strength right up until the point their fragility is revealed and a Man! needs to come and save them.  Thug-like baddies wield slug throwers.  There's still a grit and a grime to the world of Heinlein.  <br/><br/>Part of Heinlein's accessibility is rooted in the fact they carry so many echos of a time gone by.<br/><br/>Asimov, on the other hand, has a very distinct future feel.  This is not today, this is Tomorrow.  Things are sterile and little cool. Detached.  Robots are incredibly prevalent, doing both menial and rather important jobs for humanity.<br/><br/>Asimov keeps the world at an arm's length, further isolating the truly important questions at hand for us to examine.<br/><br/>Asimov has retina scanners, Heinlein has palm readers.  You could ask "so"?  But one is cool, collected, scientific.  It's a very clean form of identification.  Where as the palm is a tool of work.  It gets sweaty and scared and can be "slapped" down onto a reader in the heat of the moment.<br/><br/>What I expected from our Diaspora game was more Heinlein, less Asimov.   More grit, less polish.  More Firefly, less Star Trek.  Which is sort of moot as what we <i>actually</i> played was some sort of Kipling-esque White Man's Burden of these poor, ignorant-of-their-past natives and how best we could bring them up to speed in the cluster.<br/><br/>Which only speaks <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">again</span></i></b> of just how important discussing expectations are when setting up a new game up.  The introduction of the Ormhilder people being decedents of the Iren was perfectly acceptable.  Kind of awesome in fact. But the doggedness with which we (okay, mostly Jesse and myself) pursued that avenue could have been curbed if we'd each known that wasn't really the focus of the game.  We could have handled that off to NPCs to handle while we went along our merry Zero-G way.<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>You asked what differences I saw between Heinlein and Asimov, and I hope I helped elucidate that. : )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273820/#Comment_273820" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T11:51:30+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 11:51AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great show as always, guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse: I agree with Walker, that was very well thought out. I have just a clarificatory question. Is it necessary for the mechanics to give your character a mechanical <i>advantage</i> for hitting those emotional buttons, or merely acknowledge them in some mechanical way? If the former, then your point makes good sense, and it just comes down to playstyle. If the latter, then it seems like FATE already has what you want with the compel mechanic. Your apothecary makes the mechanically dumb choice to attack a +5 character, and you get a FATE point for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273825/#Comment_273825" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T12:32:52+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 12:32PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter,<br><br>That's also a very interesting follow up question.  And to some extent my answer is: Huh, I don't know.  So I'll try to lay out some general principles I hold.<br/><br/>I don't like certainty in my games.  Over time I've come to prefer games that include mechanics to "weight the odds" that all that happens BEFORE the roll and once the dice hit the table the outcome is final.  FATE is a post-roll adjustment system and so it already sits in a weird place for me because I'm making knowable decisions.  I'm effectively DECIDING about success and failure rather than simply ensuring  that "what counts" is represented.<br/><br/>I like games that operate on a moment-to-moment basis.  If pulling the knife and attacking the superior swordsman is simply a single roll of the dice which I will likely lose but I get a FATE point because I'm effectively compelling my "Flames of Passion" Aspect or whatever.  Yeah, sure, I'd likely be cool with that.  But if it's an extended contest than I prefer that "emotional representation" to be present in some form for each and every action.<br/><br/>In the Diaspora game we got into a lot of extremely high stakes, personally important mini-game focused conflicts.  Outside of the Compels that simply deny action AT ALL, there really isn't any of that kind of dynamic inside the mini-game systems.  And once the FATE points are gone there isn't any of the other kind on a moment-by-moment basis either.<br/><br/>I also prefer games that are about the character's fighting and struggling for what their character's care about.  I like it when the players are trying to "do right" by their characters which is not the same thing as "winning" or always making the "smart" choice.  What I mean by that is that moment-by-moment they consider what their character wants, how their character would go for it, and then they make the best try for that they can.  I'm not a player to say, "Well, I think my character would do X but I really want him to fail because that's a more interesting story."<br/><br/>I'm of the firm belief that story is best thought of as the RESULT of impassioned characters in motion and not a goal or something one should achieve directly.  I often worry that the whole Compel mechanic is just too high level for me.  It's about Story as an observable and directly controllable object and not the by product of a process.  I just don't enjoy the calculated "story arc"-ness of well, I'll fuck up and now so that I can win later.  It simply feels too contrived and pre-planned for me.<br/><br/>That all said I will say that I am completely spoiled by basically the trinity of Burning Wheel, Sorcerer, and The Riddle of Steel all of which on some level have Character Investment = Increased Character Effectiveness somewhere in their design.  But that usually comes at the price of increased narrative risk at that moment.<br/><br/>So maybe my answer to your question is: Yes.  But I feel like it's heavily qualified, exception laden Yes and I'm not sure I can articulate those qualifications succinctly yet.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The rules are really clear on this.  We found this out when Sean tried to use a Compel to force an NPC to attack him instead of his declared target (Laura).  So self-compel's inside a mini-game aren't really possible.  It's entirely in the hands of the GM.  Also I found the "lose a turn" nature of mini-game compels to not be particularly fun or interesting.<br/><br/>OTHER forms of Compels I'm very on the fence about because I'm not entirely sure how to interpret compel worthy actions.  I'm perfectly fine with taking *risky* actions.  I'm not very fond of deliberately tanking the situation for the sake of Drama.  When I played Dresden with Ryan he seemed rather generous about this.  When I went to meet an old relationship mine in kind of sketchy situation he gave me a FATE because she was an Aspect of mine.  The situation actually turned out quite well for me because I navigated it well.  The FATE was for taking on the RISK, not just for making things worse for me.  In our Diaspora game Will was taking what appeared to be a much more hard-line approach.  We had to do something that actually tanked the situation and made things demonstrably worse, right here and now for it to be worth the FATE.  Taking on risk that *might* actually turn out okay if we played things right was not enough.  At least that was my read of it, maybe I was not reading it well since there was a lot of mis-communication in this game.<br/><br/>Okay, now for Joshua....<br/><br/>I think I have to draw a line between Conflict Actions and Non-Conflict Actions.  When I have my character take action and someone steps up to oppose him then I fight for what I believe the character actually wants even if I think that winning will put him in a worse position in the long run.  My most "meta-y" thinking occurs when I take Non-Conflict actions which usually happen between scenes.  Stuff like, "I think my character is going to go talk to Joe" and so we set up a scene with my character and Joe.<br/><br/>What tends to happen is that if I think there's something my character is being problematically stubborn about I *might* (not always) try to angle him into situations where an opportunity might present itself for him to have a revelation.  So let's say my character is perpetuating a lie and as you say actually being caught in this lie will somehow serve his best interests.  I might look at the situation and think, "Damn, if he doesn't figure out this lying thing is hurting him he's going to be screwed.  Hmmm....  But you know, I bet NPC Joe could talk some sense into him."  And I'll come up with some other really valid in-character reason to go have my character talk to NPC Joe.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing.  Maybe NPC Joe as played by the GM simply doesn't even attempt to talk sense into him.  That's fine.  I don't even usually bring it up.  That means to me that the GM's investment in Joe doesn't include talking sense into my character.  I'm no fonder of jiggering with the GM's honest play of the NPCs than I am of jiggering with my own honest play of my character.<br/><br/>But here's an even MORE interesting point.  Let's say the GM does have Joe try to talk some sense into him but the way the GM speaks for Joe doesn't hit me quite right emotionally.  I'm thinking, "Man, there's no way my character would buy that out right.  He's in pretty deep denial about this."  Well, that's a conflict.  Does Joe talk sense into my character?  So, I'll usually ask for a roll myself at this point.  And then I'll fight tooth and nail to keep my character in denial because that's what my character wants.  Change hurts.  And even though, I'm screaming inside, "No you idiot!  Listen to JOE!  Listen to JOE!" I'll stack on all the bonuses and widgets I can because if I don't stand by my character's passions, no one else will.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273957/#Comment_273957" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T22:59:36+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 10:59PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2010 11:00PM by noclue.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>OTHER forms of Compels I'm very on the fence about because I'm not entirely sure how to interpret compel worthy actions.

Please continue on with the other discussion as well.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Laura Bishop</cite><br/><br/>You asked what differences I saw between Heinlein and Asimov, and I hope I helped elucidate that. : )</blockquote>\nVery much so.  My reading of Heinlein has been limited to Stranger and thus I saw him as more 60s masculine pop philosophy than what you have described.  So thank you for that nice summary.  It's something I'll bring to bear in my future sci-fi reading and discussion.<br/><br/>I guess even after your helpful explanation, I'm not sure what you saw in the text that would have led you to have expectations for either type of author.  I guess when I think of hard sci-fi, I think of a new generation of authors (not many of whom I've read) for whom physical realism is not something you can craft around and avoid, but actually put front and center into the fiction (would perhaps Rendezvous with Rama be considered hard sci-fi?).  The text in Diaspora said very clearly to me that this was also their priority, that the kind of issues the game would be about would be humans dealing with strange environments using science as the tool to survive and perhaps prosper.

I think of "tension" as a measurement of unresolved conflict in a story, which sort of fits with your definition too since there is uncertainty about the outcome of the resolution of any conflict. I'm wondering if you like situations where player decisions can <i>increase</i> tension (e.g. by introducing a new source of conflict, or intensifying one that already exists) but not <i>decrease</i> tension (e.g. arbitrarily resolve a conflict).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I've found it really hard to read Clarke in recent years, though. His characters are so vestigial, and his rare women so distractingly ill-drawn, I have a hard time caring about Rama. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Distant-Earth-Arthur-Clarke/dp/0345322401/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275587330&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">Songs of a Distant Earth</a> is quite beautiful, and probably my favorite piece of his, primarily because it relies on emotional relationships, both between characters and between the reader and Earth.</p>\n<p>To get a good survey of Heinlein, read Starship Troopers and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Curiously, I feel like he's writing social science fiction, but his perspective is so different (kinda biting my tongue here) from Ursula K. LeGuin's or Ian M. Banks', it doesn't feel like they belong on the same shelf. Asimov is writing personal allegories about the human spirit (a lot like Bradbury), so it doesn't really feel to me like it's meaningfully on that same continuum from Hard to Social/Soft.</p>\n<p>I'm treating the hard science as hard, and the social science as soft, in Shock:Human Contact. The function of the hard stuff \u2014 the astrophysics, the biology, the technologies \u2014\xa0is to provide good grip for the soft stuff: the societies and the characters who comprise them. It provides infrastructure.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure there are ways to do pure Hard SF. My Xenon: project is kinda like that, actually. But I sure as fuck can't figure out how to make it fun. I think both Brad and I are interested in different stuff from that, but love the depth and verisimilitude it provides.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274294/#Comment_274294" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T11:11:04+00:00" title="June  3, 2010 11:11AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><br/>I guess even after your helpful explanation, I'm not sure what you saw in the text that would have led you to have expectations for either type of author.

I think the text of Diaspora is sufficiently (and intentionally) setting-neutral such that most of the specific flavour of any given game will be imparted by the reader of the text or the creators of the cluster. My touchstone sci-fi authors are Iain M Banks and Ken McLeod (and the Transhuman Space setting for GURPS), so in the absence of strong setting cues from the text, everything I read in Diaspora was filtered through that lens. But, when I think about it, if you didn't have that approach, you probably wouldn't see those authors in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274704/#Comment_274704" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-05T20:35:11+00:00" title="June  5, 2010  8:35PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So my best friend's girlfriend flies into a blood rage and tries to shoot him, I jump hoping I can get the gun from her in time.
