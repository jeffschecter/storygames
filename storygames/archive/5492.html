It's aimed at kids, quite possibly ones who have never owned pen and paper RPGs before, but who have played the web game. For this reason I think I'd like to use D6s as the dice, because it's easier than expecting them to go and buy D10s somewhere. Unfortunately the stats used in the web game are percentile, and I'd like to keep with the fact that, say, a score of 30 is not unusual for a starting character, while 80 is really good.<br/><br/>So the problem is, how do I simulate that using only D6s. What mechanic can I use that lets a score of 50 succeed half the time (or so, the web game is not totally percentile), while making a 10 poor and an 80 awesome. Ideally I'd like to use the units too (so 86 is better than 80), but I can live with that being used to break ties and the like.<br/><br/>I was toying with rolling a D6 for each 10's digit and then counting the number of 6s, or 5+s, but that's not a great approximation and doesn't do the units.<br/><br/>Any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123176/#Comment_123176" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T18:15:45+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  6:15PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2008 6:17PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited: I totally misread that.

That works out something like:<br/><br/>One die: 17%<br/>Two dice: 31%<br/>Three dice: 42%<br/>Four dice: 51%<br/>Five dice: 60%<br/>Six dice: 67%<br/>Seven dice: 72%<br/>Eight dice: 76%<br/><br/>So, although it's not exact, there's pleasing gaps between the probabilities for each number of dice, and it's acceptably close to 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 percent, tailing off as you go higher.<br/><br/>By the way, go to bed.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123181/#Comment_123181" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T19:07:59+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  7:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went to bed ... then I went to sleep ... then the wind got worse and I think my roof started leaking, so I woke up again <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>But cool, those probabilities look just right (well near as dammit), and ties between equal numbers of 6's can be broken by the best actual stat, units included, which gives a value to the whole number (and allows stat increases just to be in whole points, which equate to a new dice every 10 points).<br/><br/>Thanks Graham!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123212/#Comment_123212" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T01:43:54+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:43AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could use the first digit and add it to the dice roll, as a simple option.

I did a system like that a while back (essentially like D20 tests but with a smaller dice) and I found the range of possible results unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>I think I'm going with roll D6s equal to the first digit, looking for 6s. Simple tests just require 1. Extended tests require more than one, and you could accumulate them (e.g. to find something in a library you need 5 6s rolled, with one roll a day, to see how long it takes). Opposed tests, of course, require more 6s than the opponent, ties broken using the whole number (not just the second digit, since that kind of messes up it's use to track advancement <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Counting 6s is easy for younger kids, but it's a nice robust system for the older ones too.

I have that issue with Ars Magica for example, where the contribution of the stat (in the range 1-3) is much less than the contribution of the dice when no skill is involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Astinus" title="Astinus"><img alt="Astinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Astinus">Astinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123367/#Comment_123367" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T10:28:37+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 10:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, to be really crunchy and brute force about it, you could just take the percent chance of rolling over a given number. For example, on 1d6:<br/>\n<br/>\nNumber........ Odds of rolling equal to or greater than<br/>\n1.................   100%<br/>\n2................. ~83%<br/>\n3................. ~66%<br/>\n4.................   50%<br/>\n5................. ~33%<br/>\n6................. ~17%<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn this lack of monospace font.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, you could add or subtract one or two from the roll for helpful or complicating circumstances, respectively. Alternatively, you could have it set up so that you need to roll a lower number to succeed as your skill in something goes up and perhaps have different values where your "success number" or whatever you're going to call it changes. For example, a skill of 1-17 only succeeds on 6's, 18-33 on 5+, 34-50 on 4+, etc. and an easy skill might have it so that 1-17 succeeds on 5+, 18-33 on 4+ and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few problems with this, though. This is in no way intuitive. That's just raw probability versus a stat. Next, it seems (to me) to be really arbitrary. If this is for kids, they might become a little confused as to why they succeed on 4's or higher now that their whatever is 34. It just seems a little awkward. Speaking of awkward, this system gives really volatile results, but you might want that. Lastly, if you want to have some skills "easier" than others and have their "success number" change at different values you'll probably end up with players frequently cross-referencing a huge table or index of skills or errors when characters advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would go with Graham's dice pool method for the sake of simplicity. While this method could be cleaned up a bit by having you succeed on a lower number every 20 increments in a skill (1-20 on 6's, etc.) you still get messed up leaps and bounds in your proficiency in a given task, particularly when you start succeeding all the time (84+) unless you are stuck in an unfavourable circumstance. I just wanted to throw in an alternate idea out there and perhaps a way to play with only one or two dice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123370/#Comment_123370" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T10:33:05+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 10:33AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about (2d6-2)*10?
