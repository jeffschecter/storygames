I put this game aside for quite a while and picked up designing it again recently. Thankfully some of the changes I've made seem to be working pretty well, and the two playtests I've organized since have been very successful. I have yet to playtest the endgame mechanics, so will be doing that shortly, hopefully.<br/><br/>This evening Phil, Martin, Arthur and I played in a Theocratic/Temporal dystopia. I discussed with the other players the fact that I've been considering dropping temporal dystopias from the list of random dystopia types for a few reasons, but we decided to go with it as an alternate history setting. Martin suggested a sort of alternate history where Saladin beat back the crusades and kept a grip on the region until the present day, but then became enthused by an alt-WWII where the Warsaw uprising was wildly successful, and the jewish people helped stop Hitler in his tracks, earning plaudits and eventually allowing a lot of Europe to become a jewish theocracy. we didn't go into great detail about how this happened to come about, and it wasn't important to us in the fiction particularly. We each decided on a "chain" which are the setting's tools of oppression - we ended up with <b>The Empty Hand</b> (deprivation), <b>The Fix</b> (dependency), <b>The Maze</b> (delusion) and <b>The Fist</b> (terror).<br/><br/>Phil played an "underground heretic", Arthur was a "pork runner" (derogatory slang for a smuggler and black market dealer), Martin was a "propagandist who has seen too much" and I was an "aging enforcer of the faith." <br/><br/>In the first scene my character Moishe was kicking down the door to a suspected heretic's house and rifling through their belongings with a couple other enforcers. I described him as a booted man all in black with a wide-brimmed hat, sidecurls, and a greying beard framing a tired face. Moishe was here to find evidence to link the local heretics into a larger conspiracy, in order to fulfill his drive "I hope I can destroy the heretical" We turned over a card to indicate the dystopia's chain for the scene, and it was Clubs - The Maze, controlled by Martin. Martin narrated that as Moishe was searching for this evidence he kept finding passages from the Torah pasted around the room, and the passages seemed to form a kind of chain, a story, that made Moishe feel humble and as if he was in the presence of true faith, though he knew these people are heretics. We play out the resolution mechanics, which involve playing cards on the table, all of a single suit. We play a few, and then I fold and narrate Moishe falling to his knees in genuine prayer, overcome with this feeling of faith. His fellow enforcers grab him and drag him out of the house in disgust, taking him to the nearby temple headquarters.<br/><br/>To not be overly cryptic, the title of the thread is based on 1) our constant observation of the illegality of foods considered non-kosher and 2) a bizarre headtrip played via hallucinogens by the dystopia on one of the characters. I promise to relate it in full when more well-rested.<br/><br/>It's late, so I'll stop there for now and post more scenes and observations tomorrow, perhaps. If anyone has any questions or comments, feel free.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318923/#Comment_318923" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T15:05:20+00:00" title="April  5, 2011  3:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the delay in case there's anyone reading this - started a game of AW and I'm working on Fronts and stuff a lot at the moment.<br/><br/>So, the next scene revolved around Samuel Bergstein, the underground heretic. In an attempt to open the mind of the people, he hacks into a government website and tries to plant a slight change to the hebrew font the page is in, making it resemble the word "pig". As he's hacking the system he realizes that his firewalls are detecting unusual activity and his webcam light has suddenly come on, and he can tell a police tracker program is attempting to pinpoint his location through the system. Phil is losing the conflict, and can't match the dystopia's play, until he fills in a fact about his character to draw some more cards. Phil answers "What have you lost?", draws three cards, and tells about how Samuel's father was also an underground heretic, instrumental in setting up the darknet where the resistance still plans things, and eventually was found and terminated due to a police tracker program - so Samuel takes extra precautions, and the tracker program is actually pinpointing another address that has nothing to do with Samuel. Phil plays a card, the dystopia folds, and Samuel successfully plants the hack on the webpage.<br/><br/>Next up was Arthur's pork runner, moving a cart of non-kosher medical supplies (pig organs, blood, etc) through underground tunnels to be used by doctors treating the heretical and those in desperate enough medical need that they're willing to break the religious and secular law. As they trundle down the tunnel, I narrate the sound of boots and glare of searchlights reaching them - I'm responsible for The Fist. Arthur can't win with his cards the way they are, so he fills in the detail "What have you lost?", telling about his family who were deeply religious people who were killed when the fundamentalists took power. Arthur draws three cards and still can't match the dystopia. He folds, and the jackbooted police drag them away - bar one of his fellow runners, whom was a mole within their ranks.<br/><br/>Okay, enough scenes for now. Seriously though, questions would be appreciated - the more I talk about this, the better the end product will be. So, hit me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
