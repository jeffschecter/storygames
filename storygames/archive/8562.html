What sorts of setting details inspire you and how do they do it?<br/><br/>I mentioned being inspired by npcs, trying to find the conceptual threads that tie them together, then extrapolating from that into a larger world. What I didn't mention is that I find that the most minor details, the ones that have to do with everyday life, that inspire the most interesting stories. For example, the NPCs in the adventure Deep Trouble for Over the Edge have dissasociative personality disorder (multiple personalities). Individual personalities may be tied to antagonistic, competing conspiracies, but it is how they greet each other that really inspires me. Because they may switch personalities several times over a night, a gathering may have one person greet everyone multiple times per meeting. This fits with the setting's focus on subcultures that often seem confusing to outsiders but perfectly sensible to members. That theme can not only be carried beyond the Deeps, but it can bring about subtle conflicts and adventures that intrigue me much more than the struggle of conspiracies that dominates the setting.<br/><br/>So, what about you? What do you find inspiring and how? Maps? Shopping lists? Timelines? Something else?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189685/#Comment_189685" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T22:45:29+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 10:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd have to say that the bits of implied setting that grab me the most are opponents.

Not only monsters though, but any premade enemies or threats really get my juices flowing for ideas, because then I get to thinking where such a challenge would come in, and how it would relate to other challenges, etc. One indie game I thought did this very well was Monsters and Other Childish Things, which had a lot of cool premade NPCs and stuff to work with, without being too detailed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189687/#Comment_189687" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T00:43:42+00:00" title="January 23, 2009 12:43AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love anything that's not nailed down, because that means I can steal it.

While this kind of statements seem to set the tone of the game quite well, for me they are nothing more that a classification necessity of marginal interest. (And my own setting does not have that One Sentence That Defines It All, which makes it extremely hard sometimes to explain it to new players, by the way).<br/><br/>Little Ideas are something insignificant on a large scale but something non-trivial, something that exemplifies those Big Ideas to prove that they are indeed cool. And I do mean Little Ideas with emphasis on "ideas", they gotta be interesting and inspiring. Not necessarily <a href="http://img0.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/b/3/9/16/9016465_unique.jpg" rel="nofollow">unique</a>, but inspiring. Fluff does it better usually, but it's not a strict requirement, as some crunchy bits can also be exciting. Give me an example of a pirate ninja being hired by a professor to meddle in his rival's research, and I'm sold.<br/><br/>Illustrations do it unsurprisingly well for me. If a picture is good, it's almost certain that I'll have the feeling that I want to use it in my game, and the variety of ways how I can use it. (yet again, illustrations are drawn Little Ideas) For instance, that's how I found use for D&amp;D4 in my campaign <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189701/#Comment_189701" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T06:36:09+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  6:36AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's places, for me.

In each role, I want different things.<br/><br/>As a player, I want to know where I fit in. The setting should inspire me by drawing me into that world. Who am I here? Who can I be? And who might I become? I like a hint of mystery, and I enjoy colorful details that give me the sense that the world is bigger than I am, even when I realize that those details will likely elude the light of play time. I like mechanical bits that let me tint my "normal" character so that it fits into this world. I like options that let me do something different than usual by virtue of playing in this setting.<br/><br/>As a GM, I want to know how to use the setting. I want neither to be too constrained nor too free. A setting must give me structure so that I know I am going down the right path, but it also needs to give me a toolkit to customize the setting to suit my preferences. A setting should inspire my GMing muse. Give me ideas that send my brain spinning down a creative path. Don't spell it all out for me, but do take care of the unpleasant chores. For example, a D&amp;D setting might give me ten plot ideas for using a certain monster, but it needs to give me well-considered stat blocks for those monsters. Also, show me how to use the setting to engage players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189710/#Comment_189710" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T07:14:04+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  7:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The part of the map where the author has written, "I will never detail this part."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189723/#Comment_189723" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T08:49:50+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  8:49AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread reminded me of something.

Too many details can be overwhelming. They want the details to be stuff used at a specific time and they don't want to sift through long prose for important high-level facts.<br/><br/>Artisans (SP = concrete utilitarians) love details, but only the useful details. There are probably a lot of "gearheads" in this group, so they like crunchy mechanical stuff in their setting.<br/><br/>Idealists (NF = abstract cooperators) want story and characters. They want to understand first and foremost the social connections, but at a high level. I'm thinking factions and important people, roles and races. They don't like to nail too much down. They prefer ideas to specifics.<br/><br/>Guardians (SJ = concrete cooperators) want story and characters, too, but they like the specifics. Who did what to whom -- when, and why, and how? They'll read a timeline and find it valuable, where an abstract player might skim it.<br/><br/>Of course, all personality-type stuff is a gross generalization, but I think the most important lesson to take from M-B analysis is that people think in different ways. A writer can focus heavily on writing for one or two types (their own, most likely), or try to write for all types by saying things in different ways and by organizing things in multiple ways.<br/><br/>P.S.

When I GMed 7th Sea I used the canon NPCs out of the book.  I choose them because as described they excited me and I wanted to play them as characters.

Part of this is a time thing, especially with rpgs that have a lot of derived statistics. Slightly modifying an existing character is just faster. Admittedly, I'm drawn to rpgs with really good npcs, so often there are a few that I want to use as is. If I didn't like the npcs as written, I wouldn't likely play the game. When I do write new npcs, I try to connect them with existing ones, and that's another way the details come into use.<br/><br/>I should mention that while npcs really inspire how I play, great art gives me that surge of energy that I use to put in the work needed to turn inspiration into things ready for use in play. I especially find that colour combinations are very powerful this way. Bad, bland or little to no art kill my enthusiasm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189840/#Comment_189840" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T08:30:42+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  8:30AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Art.<br/><br/>Maps.<br/><br/>Game system that supports the details of the setting.<br/><br/>And I like to fill in gaps, make connections, often look at maps and terrain and extrapolate the geo-politics from that point.

I tend to react to what the players are driving in the scene sense of stuff, even though I have bigger arc thematics I'm exploring. <br/><br/> LIke I did a council of Elves one time, every single NPC was created by me, several of them prior to the council in normal course of campaign play.  Because I knew the Players/PCs were trying to weave the disparate 13 tribes together, each NPC came with motivation and goals to either support or subvert or negotiate that goal.  Despite it being in the Forgotten Realms, none of the canned NPCs had that kind of structure to their goals and motivations.  They just didn't fit, unless I retooled them significantly...which I did with one canned NPC, she didn't show up but sent an envoy.<br/><br/>It was one of the most successful nights of gaming in my life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189843/#Comment_189843" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T10:36:36+00:00" title="January 24, 2009 10:36AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/>\n  RE: Your OP.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To me its facets that bring the setting alive. This usually means two things to me:<br/>\n1) Groups are real, the various cultures have multiple factions. The idea of a homogeneous culture that all believes and behaves the same way is sort of absurd and even if it is realistic, its definitely boring.<br/>\n2) Some indication of what daily life is like. Is this an agrarian society? How does trade, communication, transmission of news or other setting details work?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, I like plot hooks or unexplained mysteries as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For me, stuff that doesn't matter:<br/>\n1) Numbers - I don't care if it has 1 culture or 100<br/>\n2) Maps - Maps can be helpful, but its not a deciding factor<br/>\n3) History/Timeline - Unless it adds to the tension between factions or informs why the daily life in this setting is different from life today it is just minutiae I am not interested in.<br/>\n4) Signature characters - I hate sig characters from Elrond to Mask of Winters, these signature characters can have a rel negative impact on the players ability to interact with and/or impact the setting.<br/>\n5) Implied setting - Implied setting is great if its a genre with well established genre conventions. But I think it breaks down when it is a genre that can be re-interpreted (like steampunk can imply magic or no magic, gun powder or no gun powder or victorian or not Victorian, etc.).<br/>\n6) In setting fiction - In fact, I never read these.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope this helps.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189845/#Comment_189845" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T11:15:39+00:00" title="January 24, 2009 11:15AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever a book goes into detail about what the average day or the day to day life is like for a character in a setting, that pulls me in more than anything.
