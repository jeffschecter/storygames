If you've published something through IPR, could you advise me on how many I should print, as a first batch, and who with?<br/><br/>Play Unsafe has sold well (350 copies) and still sells at a steady trickle (say, seven per month). IPR will attend conventions where I won't be present, too.<br/><br/>I gather the minimum number of copies is 30, but I'm wondering if I should go higher than that.<br/><br/>Any advice appreciated.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172535/#Comment_172535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T04:51:26+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:51AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The market may have changed some since I was selling Push, but I suggest starting with 40-50 copies, seeing how they do, and going from there.  I don't think you'll have a hard time moving that many over the course of a year (you might do it a lot faster), and having to reorder things or having your game out of stock sucks.  I wouldn't do 100 copies, say, until you get a sense of how fast they're moving.  I sent batches of Push to IPR in 50-copy batches and sold through two of them before switching to my new publishing plan.  Not sure if the tanking American/world economy should lead you to be more cautious or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172537/#Comment_172537" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T04:57:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you'll get a number of orders from game shops now that you've sold a lot directly yourself. Certainly that's been my experience on BoxNinja books.<br/><br/>So, from my POV you need to do two things: have enough books to last six months, and get the unit cost down as much as possible (since you'll get less money on a retail sale).<br/><br/>If shops in the US order even semi-steadily then 30 copies will mean you re-order books and have to send them to the warehouse in only a few months from now. I'd say send 50 and see how it goes -- it could be 6 months worth. If it does better than that then you can adjust accordingly.<br/><br/>If you hadn't sold so many already I'd say you could send more than that. But a short run of 50 copies from a digital printer and only one shipping bill is better than smaller runs and multiple shipping bills.<br/><br/>And will you have a PDF on there? It's additional income in my experience and I've not noticed it killing print sales for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172546/#Comment_172546" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T06:11:56+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  6:11AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I wouldn't do 100 copies, say, until you get a sense of how fast they're moving.</blockquote>\nI would, honestly.  100 will sell eventually, especially of a book like yours that's going to be unique in game stores.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172692/#Comment_172692" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T16:40:42+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very useful.
