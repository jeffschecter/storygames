It's exciting. My players are all college kids and while most of them have roleplayed before, it's only really been D&amp;D, and pretty lame D&amp;D at that (i know their old DM, he's pretty dry).<br/><br/>So i want to impress, create some atmosphere, really pull out the fireworks. I've been working on a playlist for the game but i'm coming up a little short. I want about 9 hours of music i can put on shuffle, turn down low in the background and not worry about. Fantasy, but not cheesy. <br/><br/>I read the suggestions in the BW books, and while I love Fire On High's "Blessed Black Wings" as much as the next guy, i think it may be a little heavy handed. I want something Passionate but understated. Vocals are okay, but they shouldn't be super dominant. Big Wagner-esque orchestration is acceptable only in small doses (suggestions with strong actiony content should be noted as such, i'll make a separate Fight! playlist).<br/><br/>So story games, help a brother out. What do you listen to during a (fantasy) game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135514/#Comment_135514" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T08:01:54+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  8:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS- here's what i'm starting with:<br/>\u2022 Espers - II (an album of folky, renny, kind of sad music with song titles like "dead king" and "moon occults the sun")<br/>\u2022 Nick Cave &amp; Warren Ellis (no not the guy who wrote trans-met) - soundtracks to the films "The proposition" and "The assisnation of Jesse James" (the least westerny western soundtracks ever. worlds away from morricone)<br/>\u2022 Joanna Newsom - Ys (the game is going to play with the legend of Ys a little bit, so this one really fit. Yeah this is a bit vocal heavy, and i'm not going to use every song, but some of it is really nice. Particularly "Cosmia" and "Sawdust and Diamonds")<br/>\u2022 NIN - Ghosts 1-4, Still (about half of this stuff is good, moody, spacy, and inspite of it's digital sheen, not out of place)<br/>\u2022 Moby - Not from any particular album, moby was doing some very cool old-worldy ambient stuff around the time of the "animal rights" album, i'm pulling a lot of that and some b-sides i dug up.<br/>\u2022 Tom Waits - Old tom's got a couple very gamey tracks. While he may be more american gothic material, albums like Alice, Bone Machine, blood money, and swordfishtrombones have some nice sorrowful maritime shanties that go down well. Also, i have a hard time doing anything in life without involving Waits' music.<br/>\u2022 John Zorn - Bar Kokhba (an entire album of really dark klezmer and traditional middle eastern night music)<br/>\u2022 Steve Reich - 6 Marimbas, Music for 18 musicians (modern composition perfect for weird dungeons and ruined castles)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135517/#Comment_135517" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T08:15:00+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  8:15AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. It's hard to rec music, because for me it mostly serves as a distraction.<br/><br/>Themey music (like, "oh, it's a combat scene! cue the music!") tends to get in the way.<br/>Classical music can put me to sleep.<br/>Music with lyrics distacts me.<br/><br/>However, I do use music a lot in gaming, I use it turned down low, basically the equivalent of "white noise", to keep me focused. For this, I recommend:<br/><br/>Drum and Bass, namely the Artcore 2 and Artcore 3 albums. Stuff that's mellow and without lyrics.<br/>Ian Pooley<br/><br/>Some space music is ok. I subscribe to www.hos.com, so I've got a bajillion albums and sets at my beck and call. Problem is you want something with movement, because something too soft just makes you want to lay down and sleep (or ME, anyway).<br/><br/>One classical-ish album I like is a compilation called "Music for Concentration". It works. Crazy.<br/><br/>Windham Hill '94 is a great collection of chill ambient/celtic tunes, with only 1-2 tracks that are perhaps too mellow.<br/><br/>Other than that, I pretty much roll the extended soundtracks of the anime HACK//sign (there's like 4+ albums in the set total, but it's good stuff). Sometimes I drop Twelve Kingdoms. The music soundtrack to Persona 3 is pretty good, too. But again, this is fantasy-ish music that rolls in the background to act as white noise to focus attention, I can't recommend 'cranking it' to create mood.<br/><br/>But if there are others that are all OCB and easily distractable like I am, the above may help.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135521/#Comment_135521" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T08:37:53+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  8:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would not mind music during games, though as Andy suggests, vocals can be annoying. It took me some 20 years to appreciate Jethro Tull because of my best friend's playing it while playing D&amp;D, and the game stopping while he sang along to his favorite tunes. As a GM though, I don't want to be in charge of the music. When I was gaming at my apartment in Raleigh in the 90s, some of my players would load up the CD changer. Since moving to Oregon, I've not had much luck, though in my Arcana Evolved Ptolus campaign, one player did actually load up the CD changer a couple times. I had purchased some sound effects and nature sounds CDs with the intention of using them during scenes, but cueing music is a major interruption of my focus so those ended up not being used.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders" title="Anders"><img alt="Anders" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders">Anders</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135524/#Comment_135524" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T08:53:08+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  8:53AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Kevin,<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about some Charalambides (I love Joy Shapes personally) and/or Six Organs of Admittance for example?

Get great movie soundtracks, for medieval fantasy, Conan, Gladiator, Thin Red Line (yes, really), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, are just some choice material. Unless you are running these settings, avoid famous soundtracks like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Too familiar and connected.<br/><br/>Cherry pick the tracks and either remember, or rename them for a theme.   Stuff like "dark and moody" or "spooky" or "combat scene" and "emotionally dramatic".  Then play just that track when you need it.  I avoid any modern music for fantasy games,* it just takes everyone out. I avoid classical most of the time because they have their own thematic thread that isn't always good for the right mood.  Cinematic scores are written to be in the background, to underscore what is going on, and to reinforce a specific feel for the given scene it was written for. In short, they're perfect for RPGs. I will also get into instrumental stuff, particularly a modern spin on traditional sound (like Cheb i Sabbah or Dhol Foundation for combat with an asian feel) depending on the genre. But Hollywood soundtracks are filled with appropriate sounds if you're going for something with a Western civilization feel. And with more foreign films getting higher quality and coverage in the West, those are good sources for non-Western stuff too.<br/><br/>*The exception is usually end credits, maybe opening credits. Many shows often have some modern song over the credits, even if it breaks genre, with only the lyrics fitting some theme of the show or movie. I've done this for Exalted and Werewolf and it was fun.  It's also a good way to say "We are playing now" or "We are done now".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan" title="MountZionRyan"><img alt="MountZionRyan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/426/nG1TIXTID71FS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan">MountZionRyan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135579/#Comment_135579" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T13:52:33+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  1:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2008 1:58PM by MountZionRyan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several GMs in our group use a bit of software from this site: http://www.criticalthreat.com/<br/>\nThe Key Sounds program is great for timing sound effects or incidental music.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for music Rec<br/>\n<br/>\nTod Dockstader's Aerial 1 is good dark ambient.<br/>\nSeveral tracks from Last of the Mohicans age great.

I think i'm going to try doing it with my laptop and picking and choosing songs, though for fantasy I usually find that something that fades directly into the background is good, because anything that catches any attention at all is because it's too cheesy, too jarring, or too sleepy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136078/#Comment_136078" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T21:54:41+00:00" title="March 23, 2008  9:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2008 10:24PM by orklord.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Senkowski</cite>My suggestions coming from my own gaming playlist:<br/>Thief: Deadly Shadows Soundtrack<br/></blockquote>\nI got this based on your recommendation and WOW.  This music really rules.  Lots of atmospheric creep factor, I bet it is great during the game, which I've never played.<br/><br/>Similar to this kind of music is the score for Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2.  Carter Burwell does some really interesting stuff.  Its dark and moody with a very earthy sound.  He even uses slapping water for some of the music.  Very intense stuff.<br/><br/>(edit: added the Blair Witch 2 stuff)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136423/#Comment_136423" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T02:27:33+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  2:27AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really depends on what mood you like to create. It's been a while since I've GMd fantasy games, but I've used quite extensively modern eletronical ambient, some movie scores for tavern, city, party scenes and for epic battles (Conan is excelent recomendation). And then some darker stuff when suitable, classical is nice but I've also used Corvus Corax and Elend. How ever even EBM can work, like Hocico, Dulce Liquido, Das Ich, what ever. It depends on what kind of reaction you're aiming for with music. I dont think music should be used in games lightly, it's powerfull tool in GMs toolbox and if you use heavily music, remember that silence can also be great atmospheric tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136456/#Comment_136456" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T07:39:29+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  7:39AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We used to use the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night soundtrack for a dungeon-crawling D&amp;D game, but the cheezy love song at the end would always come on during boss fights. Which might be why we always crushed the bosses.<br/><br/>I only use music for the Big Games - major battles and boss fights, encounters with Evil Itself, and the occasional one-shot. The largest one I made was a 4.3-hour, 5-disk soundtrack for "Exalted: All-Stars," a reunion of everyone's favorite characters set in New York City. During Ch-Check It Out, the subway car says "Now Entering Brooklyn." During Sea of Sorrow, the moon rotates and turns out to be Autochthon in disguise. Which is good, because the party is fighting a deathlord who's possessed the Statue of Liberty. It was a very fun game.
