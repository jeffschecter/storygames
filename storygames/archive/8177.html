So why the hell should I ever, ever cooperate with them, be kind to them, deal with them in any way at all except from a position of unassailable strength. Especially when the prize is so big. I think that's the thing: you look at that situation, and see one thing. Other people will see something different.<br/><br/>Either that, or you look at that setup, and you say: "Screw this. I can go off and MAKE A WORLD that's whatever I want it to be, and be a superhero in it. Why the hell should I give a damn about stupid family drama - which I can't win at in any case?"</i><br/><br/>I wanted to bring this up, because it occurs to me that there's a certain kind of game I like that risks having these problems. Amber is one, Nobilis is one, Rhialto-level Dying Earth is one, and my current concern Elfworld is also one. They are games where the characters are powerful, and what tends to make play interesting is not the obstacles they face, but the decisions they make. <br/><br/>In particular, since learning on RPGNet that Elfworld may very well be an ongoing concern, this particular question has been kind of gnawing at me: How do you keep the players together and focused, especially when the object is to create sweet, sweet interpersonal conflict, and the game loses much of it's drive if you drift away from that, BUT it's nonetheless tempting to drift away for various reasons? <br/><br/>Nobilis deals with the problem by having the characters deal with problems and beings BIGGER than they are, so as to keep them in line. Thus, grudges and truly epic pissing contests just aren't allowed to escalate beyond a certain point. Crude, but it works. Somehow, I don't think that's what is going to happen with Elfworld. <br/><br/>Amber has, as others noted, a lot of front-loaded game direction, but not a whole lot mechanics-wise beyond that. There's a lot of meat on those bones, but in this case, for most people, more bones (mechanics) are needed. This concerns me, because I remember on some website or another John was saying how he was originally inspired by Amber as a way to play these self-absorbed, decadent, pitiless bastards. Theoretically, that would leave Elfworld up to the same problems as Amber: If the infighting and pissing contests never stop, what prevents the Elfs from wandering away or nuking all the rest and being the sole King Bastard in creation? It's not like the Elfs <i>like</i> each other or anything, by all the accounts I've seen. There's not even the sense of familial obligation, AFAIK. <br/><br/>The Rhialto-level Dying earth games, I think, give a step in the right direction with the contest mechanics. Turn everything into a contest, which allows the players to compete on a mostly equal playing field, while at every turn the hell that's breaking loose all around them tempts them to FIX THE PROBLEM, but can they do that and still one-up all the other players? This is a little more elegant than the Nobilis solution, because it provides a tastier carrot, but there's no real plausible stick in-game to keep them together. <br/><br/>So, what could keep a bunch of distrustful, spoiled brats with power like unto gods together long enough to come up with ways to sublimate and cope with the eternal bickering, backstabbing, and avoidance of doing something productive, like creating a whole new world for themselves, or plotting to destroy every one of them but himself/herself? What happens if players decide to go nuclear and/or hermit because the backstabbing and bitchiness have gotten too much? Are there any rules for this contingency? Are there any challenges detailed that do not involve other Elfs? <br/><br/>Oddly enough, it occurred to me that a good solution to this dilemma could be found in another 'high-power' game that's coming out soon that's more relevant to my recollection of Elfworld than might first appear: FreeMarket and it's social economy. <br/><br/>Obviously, it would have to be modified to reflect the fact that Elfworld elfs are next to the opposite of social creatures, and mainly only hang around each other for the same reason Amberites hang around each other: they believe that they are the only real beings in existence, or at least the only ones worth paying attention to. It would have to favor strategies that collected tools or eliminated threats to the Elfworld way of life. It would have to reward stylish flourishes and ruthless pragmatism over trust and compromise. And the outcome of such conflicts should have a measurable impact on the effectiveness of the elf. If the elf is cagey, backstabbing, and promotes his/her superiority at every turn, then the elf becomes actually more powerful. If the elf gets hung up on moral issues, fails, mopes, and in general acts like a human being, the elf becomes less powerful, until the character is no more. Also, it might perhaps be instructive to take a look at Paul Czege's work in progress <i>Acts of Evil</i>. <br/><br/>But...while I can see the goals, I cannot see how to get there. Nor do I know if this potential problem is addressed in Elfworld, or can be addressed effectively in mechanical ways.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179855/#Comment_179855" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T08:40:42+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  8:40AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            spookyfanboy wrote: <i>"Nobilis deals with the problem by having the characters deal with problems and beings BIGGER than they are, so as to keep them in line.

Each PC deliberately comes with a built-in focus: the characters aren't random godlings born better than common rabble or elevated into Nobility merely so that they could lead fabulous fantasy lives free of all responsibilities, but rather holy champions chosen to guard and govern specific facets of existence itself. Turn your back on that, and you'll have all the interpersonal conflict that you could ever want when the Locust Court and the Imperial Inquisition take an interest in your negligence, and the rest of your Familia just might have enough sense of self-preservation left to convince you to come to your senses by whatever means necessary. Whoever your characters are, they were made for a purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179857/#Comment_179857" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T08:50:07+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  8:50AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GrimGent: Fair enough. <br><br>My main point was that games like Amber, Dying Earth (Rhialto-level), and presumably Elfworld do <b>not</b> have any of that built in.

This seems to be where Amber falls down, at least in mechanical support. And I don't remember the game text addressing the non-GM players and saying, "You have to be proactive to make this game work. Here's some tips." I'm hoping that Elfworld (when it arrives) addresses this somewhat, and not just in the GM advice section.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
