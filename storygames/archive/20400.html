It has been designed to enable various different play styles from traditional role-playing through to referee free and improvised play. It is even possible to play \u2018Fortunes Wheel\u2019 solo for ad hoc games created on the fly. It can even be used a creative writing tool. The system can be used as an add-on to other RPG systems, for your own game worlds (and you can use the system to create them as well) or one of the game worlds we will be making available especially for Fortunes Wheel.<br/><br/><b>Tools Not Rules</b><br/><br/>We all tell stories. It is built into us, a part of being human to share our experiences, our dreams and our struggles in narrative form.<br/><br/>While you could carefully construct a narrative to tell a story that is planned out very carefully in advance, you could also use random elements, visual cues or clues and construct one through the participation of several people. Fortunes Wheel is a framework for doing that. It exists first and foremost as an aid for playing role playing games (or \u2018RPGs\u2019) that are both fully improvised and made up as you go along, or which use various pre-created settings. It can also be used to just tell stories or as a way of kick starting creativity and ideas or for resolving actions.<br/><br/>What really brings Fortunes Wheel to life is that idea that everything tells a story. In many games you roll a dice and the dice tells you how many spaces to move or if your character hit his target and how much damage he did. In Fortunes Wheel it would give you clues as to why and what else might happen next and give you more insight into the result.<br/><br/>In Fortunes Wheel you draw a card and interpret it through the picture, the card meaning and any connections that spring to mind \u2013 so a card in the suit of cups might make you think of taverns, the image of the people on the card might suggest what is happening in the tavern and what sort of tavern it is \u2013 but it could also bring to mind a lake and people boating on it or a host of other things. To get the same sort of detail from dice you would need multiple rolls on endless tables. With the Tarot a single card can give you a lot more.<br/><br/>It can be used for actions as well - in combat the dice just say succeed or fail and how much damage you do. In Fortunes Wheel the cards do that, but also suggest why you hit or missed - perhaps it was a cunning blow exploiting a momentary weakness? Or a lucky hit? Perhaps you dropped your weapon or something else along the way or slipped - it can all be read into a single card result to enrich the action.<br/><br/>Want to create a character? Dice just give you stats - the cards in Fortunes Wheel give you back story as well. You can see the history of the character unfold as you create them and possible motivations for adventuring, stories and characters that may feature in their lives will start to spring up almost immediately. Even if you just used the system to add to the characters you create for another game you will get greater richness and detail with it than without.<br/><br/>While you can use dice (we have a conversion system for that), Fortunes Wheel is based around using the Tarot because every picture can tell a story to accompany the numerical result. Ideally you should have at least one pack of tarot cards to play Fortunes Wheel and one per player is actually best. If you do not have any or cannot get a deck you can use two ten sided dice instead, but the pictures on the cards can be a big help with any storytelling in ways a numerical result or description might not. We sometimes use online decks to play as well.<br/><br/>Playing Fortunes Wheel can be as simple or as complex as you wish. The actual core mechanics of the game, the tools you use to fight battles and complete tasks in the game, are actually incredibly simple. You can theoretically just play the game using the summaries of these in the appendix.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter is for the Core \u2018Fortunes Wheel\u2019 game system book and for a setting book, \u2018Witching Tales\u2019. <br/><br/><b>The Setting \u2013 Witching Tales</b><br/><br/><br/>A seemingly idyllic section of English countryside has been magically hidden for centuries in a fold in space. Cradled within is a gate to the fountain of creation itself, the Erebus, which infects Witching\u2019s inhabitant\u2019s dreams and gives birth to their greatest hopes and darkest nightmares.<br/><br/>Inspiration for the setting is found in the work of Tim Powers (with a nod to Roger Zelazny along the way) assuming he met H.P.Lovecraft on a dark night on the coast of Devon. That they discussed Arthurian legends over a cream tea that was laced with a mysterious poison that bought their nightmares to life, and unearthed a centuries old conspiracy concerning myths and legends, the creation of the universe, fallen angels, faeries and alchemy.<br/><br/>What do fallen angels and Faeries have to do with a hidden part of the English countryside, Arthurian romance and the Tarot? There is only one way to really find out - play the game!<br/><br/>A mysterious legacy has been passed on to you. A collection of notes and diary entries, scraps, maps and assorted sundry items was inherited by the designer of this game who is now sharing them with you, the reader. Armed with a pack of Tarot cards you will learn from these and the designers game constructed around them how to build worlds. You will also learn how to create guises with which you can explore them and how to battle the terrors that await.<br/><br/>In the darkness they call the Erebus, the place where all the creative energy that formed the universe is stored, there is great beauty and great danger - You might battle or befriend ghosts and monsters, faeries and angels and strange creatures from other worlds. The hardest challenge of all though may simply be yourself - your own longings and fears bought to life in the dark. Some say the Erebus is the land of Faerie itself, or the abode of the dead. Others say it is a hole in creation that sucks in all our creations and our subconscious fears and brings them to life.<br/><br/>There are dark secrets waiting to be unlocked, a hidden Nemesis that threatens the fate of worlds and the destruction of our own lurks on the edge of reality. Will you be the one to thwart Nemesis? Or will you fall, crushed beneath the fickle wheel of fate?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.fortuneswheel.co.uk/images/TumblrHeader-1-1000x352.jpg"/><br/><br/>Kickstarter: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613337354/fortunes-wheel" rel="nofollow">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613337354/fortunes-wheel</a><br/>Website: <a href="http://www.fortuneswheel.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.fortuneswheel.co.uk</a><br/>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FortunesWheelRPG" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/FortunesWheelRPG</a><br/>Free Sampler: <a href="http://www.fortuneswheel.co.uk/Fortunes-Wheel-Quickstart.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fortuneswheel.co.uk/Fortunes-Wheel-Quickstart.pdf</a><br/><br/>We only need a couple of hundred pdf only backers to get this off the ground and in print (though backing at other levels is more than welcome of course) - we have modest goals for funding but the system is far bigger than that in the potential positive impact it could have on your gaming.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449093/#Comment_449093" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-22T22:10:50+00:00" title="October 22, 2015 10:10PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You had me at "Tarot". But you lost me a bit with the missing apostrophe in the title. (Admittedly, "Fortunes Wheel" is a correct spelling if "fortune" is a plural and "wheel" is a verb, but that would be a very different game, probably about rolling fortune cookies around on the tabletop.)<br/><br/>I know, I'm a grammar nerd! But when you're selling a book, part of what it's judged on is the quality of the text, including grammar and spelling.\n<blockquote>you draw a card and interpret it through the picture, the card meaning and any connections that spring to mind \u2013 so a card in the suit of cups might make you think of taverns, the image of the people on the card might suggest what is happening in the tavern and what sort of tavern it is \u2013 but it could also bring to mind a lake and people boating on it or a host of other things.</blockquote>\nThat seems to miss a lot of potential. Much of the appeal of Tarot cards is in the deep layers of symbolism that are designed into them (whether or not you believe that the cards have actual occult powers!) The interpretations of the cards involve personality types, psychological states, conflicts, events and more, all of which seem like they could be rich sources of material for a story game.<br/><br/>For example, the Cups suit in general <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/cups.htm" rel="nofollow">represents</a> feelings, emotions, intuition, not taverns or beverages. And you could interpret the <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/c4.htm" rel="nofollow">Four of Cups</a> at surface level as being about sitting under a tree, or strange hands coming out of clouds distributing milkshakes, but it's got a lot of richer meanings about self-absorption, passivity, refusing help \u2026 or introspection, contemplation, reflection. I'd love to play a game that deeply incorporated that kind of symbolism. (Which maybe yours is, but if so the blurb doesn't seem to convey it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449094/#Comment_449094" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-22T22:17:48+00:00" title="October 22, 2015 10:17PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey, I saw that the Kickstarter page has a link to a beta/draft version of the rules \u2014 I'm skimming it now, and I see that there is a great deal about Tarot lore and symbolism.

I think it makes it ugly though (with my artist's hat on).<br/><br/>I actually think you have got where I am going with the game perfectly with your suggestion - it is actually using those rich and deep layers of symbolism to give players a series of ways to interpret and use the cards. I have a section on in the game about thinking of the cards as symbols, not just signs. It gives more flexibility and of course a much more culturally relevant way of using them because so many aspects of western culture link into it. <br/><br/>Most people don't latch onto the potential anywhere near as quickly as you have. So yes, you are totally correct.<br/><br/>I have based the wheel around the four elements, but also the four suits and even myers-briggs personality types, the passage of time and the seasons, the wheel of fortunes itself with its story of a rise and fall, the idea of the heroes journey and more. The all click in together rather nicely and players can draw on those thing as and when then feel they want to. I just find I have to take most people into it all in stages, starting really really basic and as they get used to the game adding those layers bit by bit. Otherwise people get a bit overwhelmed!<br/><br/>All the Tarot based games I have seen so far seem to miss out that completely, which has always baffled me. Why ignore the things the tarot has really got going for it that can truly bring a game to life and just treat it like dice or throw in a token card game mechanic?<br/><br/>I think you would be incredibly good at the game. Duck to water and all that.<br/><br/>Its got 14 years of research into Tarot and all sorts of related subjects behind it, but I am also still very much open to comments and suggestions - I have always seen it less as a set of hard and fast rules and more like a toolkit for giving people a range of methods they can use to enhance play, so peoples suggestions and ways of playing with it really incredibly valid and important.<br/><br/>I started role-playing back in the late 70's when it was still a bit like the Wild West and people were working out to play the damn things - I love that spirit of everyone being a part of something and not just consumers of a product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449104/#Comment_449104" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T05:51:43+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  5:51AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game sounds really interesting.

If I don't get it to people's attention somehow though it could sink like a stone and perhaps people will miss out on what I hope could be a great and enjoyable game.<br/><br/>Its all too easy to inadvertently cross a line though - I have been chatting about so many things online in so many places (and without linking the game every time) that its easy to loose track of where and when I have. Checking I have been posting links here a lot and I realise now in every thread I have been on to boot. <br/><br/>I think its probably because it becomes relevant mentioning it far more here than elsewhere because of the nature of the game and the forum and as its pressing on my mind I have just done so without paying due attention. The kickstarter is struggling and I'm exhausted, but that's a poor excuse - I should have paid greater attention to netiquette.<br/><br/>My apologies!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449111/#Comment_449111" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T17:35:33+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  5:35PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like links.<br/>life's about getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRAt0V_MJBM" rel="nofollow">connected</a> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> maybe more than one on the same topic is over cooking it .<br/>I like the look of Fortunes wheel, the only thing that puts me off, <br/>72 cards with all their different meanings.<br/>Mastering this seems a long learning curve.

I am terrible at remembering stuff like that myself and really cant be bothered. I just either quickly look the card up in the little booklet that comes with most decks, or use an online card system like this one <a href="http://www.tarotlore.com/tarot-reading/freestyle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tarotlore.com/tarot-reading/freestyle</a> that tells you the meaning.<br/><br/>There is also a handy list of all the traditional meanings at the back you can refer to with some added extras most books on tarot don't really go into so you can get ideas for places and items as well.<br/><br/>Though actually you can really just make it all up as you go along based on what the cards picture brings to mind. <br/><br/>Or do a bit of both, which is what we usually do when we play. Even 'getting it wrong' gets you an interesting result, so it's pretty simple. I sometimes find if I misread a card I just go with the misreading if its interesting.<br/><br/>The latest pdf version with a helpful Q&amp;A added is now up today - use the same link and scan through the Q&amp;A at the back and it should give you the basic idea of how it all works.<br/>I will add a printable version of the Q&amp;A alone to the website later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449125/#Comment_449125" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-25T16:09:54+00:00" title="October 25, 2015  4:09PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks an interesting game.

We are not giving them <i>permission</i> to purchase the books - we are giving them a 50% discount on the books and giving them the pdf for nothing if they are a print backer. <br/><br/>It is however the only way we can get it funded without having a far higher target or more expensive backer levels - the problem is that if we absorb the cost of print and shipping ourselves we wont be able to produce the game - we would have a higher chance of being fully funded but then find we ran out of funds to complete and people would have invested and got nothing (which we really do not want). As it is we would be working full time to produce the game on less income than we would be getting on a minimum wage job - its a labour of love.<br/><br/>Bigger companies or ones where they have a larger production team can generally absorb the costs better (especially as many pay rates that are obscenely low to their artists and designers). At the end of the day we are asking people to invest in the game so it can get into production - it is not a discount scheme. The reward is a) the game gets into print when otherwise it probably never would b) the backers have participated in a communal venture to help see that happen and c) they have the satisfaction of being listed as backers. It is not d) they get a cheap game. That's not backing a project, that's signing up for a cheap game by pre-ordering. That's something I get rather emotional about... we are looking for <i>backers</i>; people who believe in the project and want to see it happen and will support it in return for a credit and a continuing relationship with the game creators. <br/><br/>If they want the books without paying at cost we do have higher backer levels that do that - and where we also throw in extras that are quite frankly worth way more than the backer pledge. As it is we are throwing in some extra pdfs free for backers already now, and they will also get access to extras for the game through the exclusive backer only hidden room - we have always envisioned this as a project where there is an ongoing story/mystery in the setting that we would provide periodic extras for this way.<br/><br/>We agonised over this btw and just thought we really should not put up something that increased the risk to backers. <br/><br/>As it is we don't realistically think it will get funded - so <i>if </i>the game happens it will be many years down the line because we will be working on it on occasional weekends if at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts" title="Hybridartifacts"><img alt="Hybridartifacts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">Hybridartifacts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449229/#Comment_449229" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-02T08:08:56+00:00" title="November  2, 2015  8:08AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BeePeeGee - perhaps if we more explicitly offered people who back that same relationship of free pdfs <i>in perpetuity</i> with new and backer exclusive material that might change things?

You might need to research what people are willing to pay.<br/>My impression with Kickstarters is that - unless you're a well-known author or publisher - anything beyond 50$ for a hard-cover is really quite a lot for someone investing in a game/system they don't know.<br/><br/>Just as an example: John Harper kickstarted his 'Blades in the Dark' successfully based on 10$ for PDF of game, 20$ for all PDFs (all unlocked setting books), 50$ special edition hard-cover.<br/><br/>I know from cost &amp; development perspective, things look much different. I'm just saying what I feel is realistic in Kickstarter environment in my personal opinion.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts" title="Hybridartifacts"><img alt="Hybridartifacts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">Hybridartifacts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449252/#Comment_449252" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-03T08:28:32+00:00" title="November  3, 2015  8:28AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2015 10:57AM by Hybridartifacts.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the feedback - it does help.<br/><br/>I couldn't tell what kind of book 'Blades in the Dark' other than a hardback was giving people for $50 (B/W, colour, print quality - no idea), its about half the size of Fortunes Wheel and we are doing two books. Maybe be we should have offered one shorter book with lower development time, print and shipping costs. Only used free public domain clipart instead of original art or paid some kid peanuts to crate art for us. The issue still stands though - if we were to offer the books free at that sort of level we would have taken peoples money and not been able to deliver the game. <i>Its a simple as that</i>.<br/><br/>What is stopping people who dont want to invest in a game, dont have much money and are just looking for cheap deals from going for the two pdfs with bonuses? For \xa315 they would end up with four pdfs at the moment (because of hidden room backer bonuses) worth about \xa325 to \xa330... <br/><br/>I do think that obviously there are lessons we can learn from the kickstarter re backer reward structure. There are definitely things I would do differently if I were to launch it a second time around. <br/><br/>My main point though is - we have to go with what is economic and allows us to deliver the final product. At the level we have set we would be working flat out to create the books for less income than we would get flipping burgers at McDonald's - its a labour of love. We need <i>supporters</i> to get that done (which is kinda what I thought the whole point of kickstarter was) - people who are willing to contribute <i>more</i>, not get cheap deals, so the project can be realised <i>because they believe in the project and want to see it happen</i>. In return the project happens. They have built a relationship as backers with the developer and can feel good that they helped to build something special.<br/><br/>As I said, we agonised over this and we knew from the outset it would put some people off, but we also were not going to kid ourselves or anyone else that we were realistically in a position to be able to deliver a very niche and work intensive game any other way.<br/><br/>I would far rather still have put the effort into promoting and running the kickstarter and have it fail to get funded because we did it realistically and failed to get enough people who really cared about the project than to have a ton of people jumping on board, getting it all funded, and us finding we can either develop the game or ship the game - but not both!<br/><br/>Perhaps the bottom line is that the vision for what we have within the scope of what we can do is not sustainable via kickstarter in the market as it is. Perhaps someone else with more ability to absorb costs offering a different product can do something that gets funded (and easily), but we cant? <br/><br/>I am simply not going to offer people something I can't deliver though. If that means the kickstarter fails and I cant get it done, that's still preferable to me (though deeply disappointing) than making false promises.<br/><br/>As it is, if it fails to get funded (Im still saying 'if', who knows what might happen in the last week or even days) we may still try and get the whole thing developed anyway in a few more years time and if they want copies they can pay what will be effectively about the same price and get no bonus pdfs and no future discounts. Maybe that would be better for us as well? We would have no commitments with the Hidden Room to giving bonuses, and be getting profit on everything people buy. Not that any small indie development team ever really makes a real profit out of  an rpg - its pocket money. Done for the love of the hobby not to get rich.<br/><br/>Another approach would be to do another kickstarter for a revised version of the core book only, throw in some setting freebies as pdfs, target it differently to better take into account the nature of the product (and not try and do it as if its any other rpg), That sort of thing. We could maybe do that next year (the advice I have seen suggests its best to do a relaunch within 4 months). What do you think?<br/><br/>What we will probably do if it doesn't get funded is only marginally expand on what we already have in the sampler - add the more advanced creation system and more examples, neaten that up, integrate the step-by step guide fully in clear boxed sections, sharpen the text up so its more concise. If we dont go down a kickstarter relaunch route I will keep in contact with people who did back if they want me to and offer them some freebies and discounts when we do launch as a thank you for their believing in what we are trying to do and supporting us. If we do go down a rebooted kickstarter route I will see what I can do as an extra for people who backed this one.<br/><br/>One thing we have been discussing is if we do it again or release it another way only offering pdf and premium quality print (hard or soft cover). Why premium only? Because for us its also about the art and on reflection we think it would be best to just present that at as high a quality as possible. Same for the setting book which would take another year or two to develop. The issue then would be how to fill those middle backer levels, or if we can work it out so we can push that down with a single smaller book to a level where we can absorb the cost of printing and shipping ourselves somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449253/#Comment_449253" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-03T12:03:46+00:00" title="November  3, 2015 12:03PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was also put off by the reward level pricing, and have backed it at the PDF-only level. <br/><br/>I think you're entirely right to set up the kickstarter so that you know you'll be able to deliver the rewards you say. Not over-promising is a good thing.<br/><br/>I'll happily pay you via kickstarter for two things: your own creative input and the up-front costs of everyone who contributes to the project (writers, artists, editors, etc.); and the costs of producing the artefacts you provide (e.g. printing and postage costs). By using the PoD-at-cost approach, you separate the two. That's perfectly fine! You've given guide prices to how much the different hard copies will cost, and I would have been happy to choose whichever hard copy option suits my budget and taste.<br/><br/>What grates a little about your reward levels is that they don't reflect the contributor effort. Whichever type of hardcopy I end up getting, you collectively will put in the same amount of effort: the same writing, the same layout, the same art. So why am I paying you different amounts of money depending on what button I press on the PoD service?<br/><br/>A much more straightforward reward pricing policy would have been to have basically a single reward level to produce the books, and perhaps add-ons for PoD-at-cost vouchers. If you were worried about funding, use the stretch goal mechanism to fund upgrades of colour to greyscale to colour art, or more art pieces, or additional sections, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts" title="Hybridartifacts"><img alt="Hybridartifacts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">Hybridartifacts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449257/#Comment_449257" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-03T17:54:07+00:00" title="November  3, 2015  5:54PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that feedback Neil - thats true, whatever level you get would not change the amount of effort that either or my wife put into the game - we are the only people contributing to it - we have no writers or artists, though on reflection we could have done with an editor! We calculated based on how long we know it would take up to complete and at a bare minimum of money needed to devote ourselves to that.<br/><br/>I think we made a mistake trying to apply the same sort of structure we saw on other Kickstarters and yes, a single POD at cost backer level with the option to choose the quality would have been better and more sensible - it would also have freed us up to concentrate on other sorts of bonuses - free pdfs and art being the obvious ones. Putting them into stretch goals makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Maybe some people would also have really liked the option to simply choose which type of print quality they wanted when getting it instead of in advance because they would not have been committed to any one choice earlier.<br/><br/>Stretch goals would not have made any actual difference to art in regards things like size and colour vs greyscale btw because of the way we create the art - they usually take the same sort of creative effort. It is complexity in an image and the number of images that makes a real difference for us practically and that add to development time. So your suggestion about 'more art' would be more relevant than 'colour art'.<br/><br/>The biggest difference would have been concentrating on one book instead of two though - especially as the core book is pretty much written and mostly needs editing and the setting book is the one that needs most work. Perhaps that should have been a stretch goal or even a separate Kickstarter.<br/><br/>With the pdf only backer level we actually only needed around 267 backers at that level to get funded - something we had hoped should have been possible. Which does also raise questions about demand - do enough people really want it?<br/><br/>These are things where we just have to learn from experience. Its hard to foresee them.<br/><br/>Ultimately I would rather have a failed Kickstarter than one that is funded and then fails, which is why we went for an 'at cost' model, but a simpler structure would have made a lot of sense in hindsight. <br/><br/>I found an awful lot of very contradictory advice out there, some of which on reflection really did not help at all and it is very easy to get overloaded by it - ultimately its really when you do it that I think you find out the best way to approach it. Looking back at the various advice I read I think the best was that doing it helps you to learn - not only about doing a Kickstarter, but also about your market and your product and how it fits with it, what its strengths and weaknesses are and how to make all of these things better - excellent advice to help assess the project and move forward. Backer feedback has also been invaluable - and of course that's something you only really get once you have backers! There is a dynamic to it coming from actual backers of an actual project not from people you ask before hand when its all theory that produces much more practical focus!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
