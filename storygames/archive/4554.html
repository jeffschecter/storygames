If I can get enough people to commit to showing up, that might be a good venue (since my house is small).

It started small, with just my friend John, my wife Mona, and I playing Arkham Horror.  Here you can see Myself (with the glasses) and John playing against Mona's proxy...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2150/1683202638_afbb325916.jpg?v=0"/><br/>The EXTERMI-KNIT DALEK!  (Yes, she knitted that.)<br/><br/>The battle for Arkham was close, with Yig waking up and the investigators forced to do battle with him.  I was devoured, but at the end Yig was forced back into his slumber.<br/><br/>We were then joined by Patty (somelady) and her husband Sean.  We played a B-Move card game.  The game started with Grave Robbers from Outer Space, but we only played with three of the expansion sets:  Cannibal Pygmies in the Jungles of Doom, Bell Bottomed Badasses on the Mean Streets of Funk, and Berserker Halflings from the Dungeons of Dragons.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/1683202832_ac1a231cc0.jpg?v=0"/><br/>The game went on, mainly because I was extremely lucky with what I got for starting characters, and we had some homemade pizzas for dinner as we played.  <br/><br/>Finally, tho, it was time for Spirit of the Century!  We were joined by TonyLB from here, and made up characters.  We ended up with:<br/><br/>Ken Habib, a Man of Two Worlds (Asia and Africa) -- John<br/>Rosa Giavonelli, Mafia Daughter Tomboy -- Patty<br/>Randall, Lord Swagger, and his Turbine-Powered Jetpack -- Tony<br/>Fred Fortune, Playboy Inventor -- Sean<br/>Lilly Bloom, Plucky Detective (and Knitter!) -- Mona<br/><br/>After finishing our characters, where we learned interesting things about ourselves ("Wait, what does _IN_flammable mean?" "Your Father is WHO?", "Yes, yes, I'd never act this way if my mother was alive."), the characters found themselves in a zeppelin floating gently over Washington, DC, at a swanky party hosted by Fred Fortune's parents ("My Parents Paid for That." -- Sean) to look into the possibility of knitting zeppelin bags ("Don't anger the woman with the pointy sticks!" -- Mona).  The guests also included a delegation from the newly established African country of Freedonia (something that happened in one of the novels the characters shared.)<br/><br/>While Fred was talking with a senator about the knitting project, the zeppelin was suddenly attacked by Abdul, the Arab of the Air, and his bedouin warriors!  The centurions quickly squared off against Abdul and his nomads, with Fred pulling a hand-gatling gun out of his pocket (universal gadget) and Lilly and Ken attacking their foes with knitting needles and fountain pens (Anything Goes).  At one point, Randall actually threw a bedouin into a chandelier, causing it to crash to the ground and spray broken glass over the scene.<br/><br/>The bedouin fell, but Abdul managed to make it back to his airship with a Freedonian Princess.  The party quickly followed after him, either using the grappling lines the bedouin originally used, or Randall's turbine-powered jetpack.  The fight continued in Abdul's opulent, silk-covered chambers.  Fred ran down into the engine spaces while the rest of the party fought together, pulling the rug out from under Abdul's feet (literally), blinding him with another rug, and disarming him before Randall smashed into him with his jetpack, carrying Abdul out into the night sky where he fell down into the Potomac River below.<br/><br/>All seemed fine, except that Fred crossed some wires on his attempt to sabotage the zeppelin ("If it moves, it must explode" aspect compel) and Abdul's zeppelin began to explode.  The party (except for Randall, who is flying outside) managed to get to emergency biplane, only to find that there are too many of them.  So Lily calls out to Randall, who swoops in and carries her off (after a death-defying run through the corridors of Abdul's airship) only to find that she weighs too much for the jetpack to support....<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the others try to escape in the biplane, only for the release latch to jam.  Ken unties himself from the wing and forces the latch open, sending both him and the biplane into freefall!  Fred just manages to start the engine as Ken grabs onto the wing of the biplane by his fingertips!<br/><br/>Randall, meanwhile, unhooks the belt of this jet pack and ties it on to Lilly, points her in the direction of their original zeppelin, and lets go, falling into the Potomac below, while Lily flies to safety.  (Randall has a death defiance stunt, so he shall return).<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun, and would have loved to play more, but it was getting late, so we stopped there.  Why Abdul was after a Freedonian princess, we just don't know, but at least his plan was thwarted... this time.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2038/1683203052_e9d1cf1d95.jpg?v=0"/><br/><br/>I will definitely try to hold another of these in a few months, and I will give people more lead time to schedule for it.  It was great to meet some new gamers.  Thanks for coming out, Sean, Patty, and Tony!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104098/#Comment_104098" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T23:35:09+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 11:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds grand.

After we generated characters, I just looked at their aspects and threw a few of them into an opening scene with zeppelins and ninjas!  OK, bedouin ninja, but the concept stays the same.<br/><br/>After a while, we got the hang of it, and I'm particularly pleased with the maneuver combo they came up with on Abdul (pulling the rug out from under him, blinding him, and then disarming him).  But mostly, I just tried to "find the fun" and go with it.  Fate points flowed like water, and I may have not found enough opportunities to hand them out, but it was a learning experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104598/#Comment_104598" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T10:57:09+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 10:57AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a good time was had by all.
