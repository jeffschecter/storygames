The game started with an interesting coincidence just in that among Brendan, Jara, and I, the onn-GM players were all from Portland, so we set the real world events there. This was the first Don't Rest Your Head Game I've played in, and I was looking forward to it to get a better idea how the game runs, as I have read it and am interested .Some of those learnings also came out in another DRYH game Carl that I was in, an excellent game that you can read more about at http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6656&amp;page=1#Item_1 if you're interested in DRYH or in a game at least riveting to the players.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBrendan played Donovan, a man obsessed with others needing him.  Brendan writes as part of his overall con reflections at http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=147375 ([Go Play NW2008] It's Over! # 13) , I'd recommend checking that out.  Donovan is a dealer, in fact the dealer to, among many others, the two PCs.  He has larger ambitions of being a politician someday, putting this life behind him and finding via politics the ultimate in having people need him.  As we start the game, he's 30, and he's set up a deal between one gang with a lot of money and another with a lot of drugs, not telling either the other will be there.  He's also called the cops anonymously and intends to get away with money and drugs while the gangsters are taken down.<br/>\n<br/>\nJara played Kira, a teenager whose parents are pushing her through the "right" steps in life towards their presumed goals for her.  She just wants to be accepted for who she is, and is rebelling through partying and drugs, but isn't by any means just a druggie or such, she designs her own fashions.  As the story begins, she comes home in the AM after a night of partying to find her parents brutally murdered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI played Melvin, a slacker on the outside, but pretty driven about things that are important to him, especially/mainly his music.  He's a free-improvisation musician and student at Reed College.  His sister's been missing; it should be mentioned his sister has been doing speed, and in fact she's quite addicted, and Melvin actually introduced her into the drug (again, through Donovan), setting up her first deal. His feeling was and is that drugs are just tools, as he told her "just don't take too much."  Melvin grew up quite permissively, with few boundaries, a Montessori school upbringing as part of that for example, and atop that with fairly distant (not touchy-feely) parents.  Internally, but unstated, is his reaction that he wants to be part of a supportive community with boundaries. And he's very sensitive underneath his slacker exterior.  As the game opens, he is in his room working with samples from clubs, and is attacked by raven-"masked" figures.<br/>\n<br/>\nDonovan and Kira quickly unite even in the waking world.  Kira escapes more raven-figures that attack her, and she quickly learns she has wuxia-like athletics.  Donovan, on the run from the chaos of the police raid, sees her grabbed by a raven and, along with her throwing the raven, kills it with rapid gunfire.  They qiuckly unite, and soon end up in the Mad City as a final confrontation with the ravens reveals the raven-people simply wish to ask them to perform a mission for which they'll get rewarded - Kira with information on her parents, Donovan with "white powder" (he simply tells them he wants what was left behind, referring to the heroin, and they simply saw that as white powder, the two parties not speaking the same language!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelvin meanwhile is chased by his raven attackers and runs into a sort-of-Catholic schoolgirl who guides him into the Mad City.  Soon they all meet there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple things here, first the mechanics were good for swift resolution and therefore supported quick cuts from party to party, well supporting our above play.  Also, it is quite easy as you see it in play, I think the book seems a bit more complicated than it is, just because there's a few moving parts, so to speak, but the thing that's nice is that it's really a rather simple system for players to grasp after a bit, on the whole, with still some nuance of which dice you roll.  So I think it's good for the kind of system that allows for people to play quite narratively and have the dice move the story along without a lot of fretting over "winning" or worrying about screwing up too much, at least mechanically I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n(cont.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147813/#Comment_147813" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T19:45:29+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  7:45PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2 of 2 - <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there, the group spends considerable time in the bazaar of the Mad City.  They're trying to figure out what to do and what they need.  Melvin wants to avoid the raven at all costs and advocates for going to the school.  Donovan agrees, especially as it becomes apparent the school really wants both Kira and Melvin, which seems okay to him - especially I imagine after he sold his compassion for the "bullet that will kiill you"!   Melvin is dubious of such dealings but is too morally relativistic to weigh in.  As an aside, Carl does a great job with the bazaar, and gave me lot sof ideas here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEventually the PCs needed to get on their way, and tensions mounted as Kira wanted to find out more about her parents so insisted on talking to the ravents.  The PCs had heard a lot in the bazaar about the duplicity of the ravens, heightening Melvin's fears as well as getting Donovan to think dealing with them isn't a good idea until at least more is known.  There's a conflict here, with the group arguing, and Kira finally relenting, at least for now.  But later crises with a chase scene scatter the group for a bit and at another juncture Kira comes across a raven and starts discussing possibly meeting.  Melvin starts to really worry, not so much of outright betrayal by her (though it enters her mind) but that she'll accidentally lead them to him.  He almost takes her out (I didn't get a chance to really say that in the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they are ultimately off to the school, and the session ends as we finally make it their, safe - for the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was particularly interesting in that while interacting ongoing, the PCs were all quite selifishly oriented and not really gelling in terms of really seeing how they might tie their needs together.  There's two reasons for this, one is they are all rather selfish/inward, and the other is the pace and disruption of events.  The game works well for this, but doesn't force that, it's just how these players with these PCs conducted it.  And on an unrelated note, Carl has a real way of bringing the Mad City to life and that transition from the real to the unreal, it should be said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
