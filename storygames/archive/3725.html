Minutiae are the "little" details that collectively add up to the feel and tone of a given work of art or subject.  Minutiae is often derided and disregarded as "just" details, but as we all know, the details are where the devil lives, and his real estate is not unimportant.<br/><br/>Consider if you know the answers to these questions (but don't bother posting them):<br/>How many spells and secondary characters in the Harry Potter books can you name?  Do you know the eventual fate of Chewbacca, Elrond, or Charlemagne?  If presented with a blank map of the Forgotten Realms, how many things could you label?  How about medieval Europe or Asia?  Can you explain the operation of a warp drive?  How many heraldic titles can you name, and can you put them in order?<br/><br/>(A) How many questions could you answer?  Did you rise to the occasion or did you scoff and shake your head?  Do you find these things valuable and interesting, or do you consider them unimportant?<br/><br/>Now, switching over to gaming: in the games that you have played, have you enjoyed or put a strong emphasis on the creation and elaboration of things that were secondary to the "main" plotline?  Again, these are examples and are not meant to be answered item-by-item:<br/>Did you draw the map of the whole continent?  Can you even now rattle off who was in charge of which kingdom?  Did you elaborate how the airships worked, or -- more likely -- how magic worked in that world?  Or to tighten the focus, did you name all the towns that you passed through, and maybe the roads that they were strung out on?  Did you pay any attention to the trade goods that went up and down those roads?  How important was the history of your setting: did it come up in play?  Did you know it even if it didn't come up in play?<br/><br/>(B) How many of those questions had you perking up and rising to the challenge?  Are these things that you enjoy and focus on in your gaming?<br/><br/>(C) Here's the big question, the one that I'm really after: is there a correlation between (A) and (B) for you?  If you enjoy all those fiddly details in your books/films/television, do you like them in your gaming?  Is a "deep, rich, world" important to you, and do you game in order to find/create it?  Are you, in fact, a minutiae whore?<br/><br/><em><strong>Note:</strong> I am looking for negative data as well as positive data.

Out of the fictional stuff could probably put my finger on Waterdeep (if, indeed, Waterdeep is in the Forgotten Realms!), but really, I don't know.<br/><br/>(B) No perking up. This is the sort of stuff that leads to a GM spending an hour and fifteen minutes giving us the current back story of the Imperium at a GenCon Traveller game.  (True.)  <br/><br/>While I, too, once followed suggestions about mapping out continents, planning cities, creating a web of NPCs... none of it really bore fruit.<br/><br/>These days I'm concerned about what happens between PCs and PCs and PCs and NPCs.  The details are color to latch onto to either a) create more of a patina of "reality"; b) allow players and GM to create more opportunity for choice, action and detail to reveal character.<br/><br/>Without the touches of reality the issues at stake for the characters have no weight or meaning.  But the details serve the characters and that's it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying no background (at all).  But I'm saying Flags, R-Map, and a broad situation is enough for me. Details can be added later. <br/><br/>Details that get "called back" (an NPC, a place, a story told by an NPC) matter because that means the Players care.  They get enriched -- but only to the degree they help foster choice and action, as above.<br/><br/>(C) Definite correlation.  To my tasted, minutiae just gets in the way of, and takes time away from, character choices, actions and interactions.  <br/><br/>Since I got reamed on this on a thread about <i>HeroQuest</i> on The Forge some time back, I'll say what I like isn't some sort of detail-less void without any semblance of reality.  But it's certainly not playing within a world of details that could exist without the characters.<br/><br/>Imagine the magic mustered in the casual deployment of the phrase, "The Clone Wars."  In passing.  Without any explanation.  Even without any explanation it has weight. Why?  Because a young boy desperate for adventure has just found out that the man sitting next to him -- a man he has dismissed all his life -- has lived exactly the kind of life he wants to live.<br/><br/>That's what I'm talking about.  In "A New Hope" you know enough to keep the thing moving, but no one ever stops the tale cold with a big lump o' "Here's what the Force is in dull discourse, even though it has no bearing on the events that are about to transpire."<br/><br/>The first 250 pages of The Lord of the Rings are filled with pastoral and historical summaries of ancient events -- that's why it took me four tries and 20 years to finally make it past the first 250 pages.  When things were happening I was <i>there</i>.  On those pages where minutiae rules, it was like, "Okay, if I can get through this, I'll eventually get back to where the book will get good again."<br/><br/>I think I'd like my games to run as lean as a good play, movie or novel.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83540/#Comment_83540" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T15:57:12+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  3:57PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I do not like other peoples' minutiae.

I'd probably not perform super well on the sample question in (A), but that's just because it's not my minutiae.<br/><br/>In answer to (B), for the Spirit of the Century game I ran a few months ago I spend hours on Wikipedia linking a random airship that was narrated out of whole cloth to a real-world airship, and populating the passengers with real world significant figures.  I poured over a map of Connecticut to make sure that the completely fictional town I was plopping down was in a plausible location.  I looked over lists of 18th century pirates to select the best one to be my featured pirate ghost.  The pay off in play was mixed.  The fact that an 18 year old Greta Garbo was on board the airship went completely unnoticed, but the fact that the LZ126 was being handed over to the Americans as war reparations became a significant character motivation.  It certainly boosted my enjoyment, even the stuff that the players never delved into.<br/><br/>However, because I always wind up doing this sort of thing in my prep, that level of work and commitment often discourages me from accepting the GM mantle in the first place.<br/><br/>And clearly in my case (A) and (B) are related.

I know some of the media minutiae, but don't *need* to know it.  It's more sort of an ambient I'm soaking in it thing.  <br/><br/>I find minutiae in print -- especially in gaming books -- to be horribly, horribly tedious.  Text on the page, especially when it's tiny details that I have to find the time to read, read, catch, and comprehend (failure in one or more of those four items is inevitable with me), is often useless to me.  I want my big themes, a few arrows pointing in directions to go, and then out.  <br/><br/>There are always exceptions to this.  <br/><br/>But put 'em all together, I'd say, on C, I'm more of a media minutiae-er than a rpg minutiae-er.  I think by and large this is because the worlds of RPGs are usually not crafted as well as the worlds of other media.  I mean -- I kind of hate saying this -- but across the past several decades of soaking in the things, it's been incredibly, incredibly rare that an RPG setting actually hits my mark for well-written.  Too often the work strikes me as coming out of a "well, I couldn't get published as a novelist, so here's where I'll parade the flaws that prevented that goal, in the form of good-enough-for-an-RPG writing!" thing.  (Please read that charitably; I'm talking about the whole swath of 20-odd years of RPGs.  Great strides towards interestingness have been made more recently, even if there's a bunch of stuff out there that still doesn't grab me.)<br/><br/>Again, there are lots of exceptions to the above.<br/><br/>Lots.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm very, very impatient with what I take in.  Be important to be noticed, otherwise get gone.  I can fill in the gaps just fine myself, thanks.  In the end, this makes me a Minutiae Prude.<br/><br/>But where Shreyas was on point was where he's talking about being a nut for the minutiae created *through play*.  This, I am a nut for.  When I'm a player, every detail I throw out there or hear someone else create is something I want to follow up on.  As a GM, I see it as a sacred duty to remember as much of that stuff as possible and make sure to push it all out there in new and interesting combinations for the players.<br/><br/>Which taken all together says one simple thing: unless minutiae are personal and relevant (which stuff created through play is, or at least should be, by default), there's no point to paying them heed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83559/#Comment_83559" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T17:31:35+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  5:31PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A.

In other words, enough detail to support reality, enough attention paid to details the players focus on and increasing the detail if the interest grows.<br/><br/>Is this minutia to you? Because I'm confused right now.<br/><br/>Shreyas wrote: "I love when my group makes minutiae together and talks about it at length."<br/><br/>iago spoke approvingly of this notion, saying: "But where Shreyas was on point was where he's talking about being a nut for the minutiae created *through play*. This, I am a nut for. When I'm a player, every detail I throw out there or hear someone else create is something I want to follow up on. As a GM, I see it as a sacred duty to remember as much of that stuff as possible and make sure to push it all out there in new and interesting combinations for the players."<br/><br/>But I don't see these as these as the same thing at all.  At least not as presented.  Shreyas' "talking' seems like nattering death to me (as I imagined his meaning), While Iago speaks of using details "in play" -- which is what I'm all about and seems contrary to talking about something at length.<br/><br/>Regardless of how I might have misunderstood either shreyas or iago, what do you mean "minutia"?<br/><br/>If I"m playing <i>Sorcerer</i>, I'm going to be encouraging players to add as much detail to the ritual for bonuses as possible -- because the more details they add the more icky and moral details come into play.  Is that minutia?<br/> <br/>I don't think so -- not as I thought you defined it in your first post.<br/><br/>I guess I'm making a distinction between "detail" (useful color used in play that is attached to players, interactions and choices), and "minutiae," that can exist in a 180 page source book and sit on a shelf, never connected to character, interaction and choice and that could lead to a 114 page internet discussion about how the author got things write or wrong about a setting even if no one <i>ever</i> played the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83569/#Comment_83569" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T20:44:59+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  8:44PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2007 8:47PM by DanielSolis.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark me down as being in Shreyas and Fred's camp.<br/><br/>While I didn't know much about the questions you specifically asked, I could probably tell you quite a bit about the Stargate universe just from having been a casual watcher of the tv series.

He and his players are going into that game understanding that there's a set of information to be discovered that has some depth to it so that the rout to the solution isn't immediately obvious because it's the only well worked out part. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn another game that's about something else, what minutia is important is going to vary. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut everyone agrees that excessive minutia, for minutia's sake, is a waste of time. And everyone also seems to agree that any minutia created in play to support what's going on is valid exploration. A lot of fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the theory is that there are groups of people for whom play is all about "immersing" in a setting so detailed that it becomes very believable. The players supposedly don't want to be engaged in creating detail, because that takes them out of the stance that they want to be in, and forces them to realize that the world is not some "real" thing, but maleable and based on the ideas of some participant. We always know this intellectually, but the theory is that, with enough detail, the momentary illusion of the reality of the setting becomes a strong feeling. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the theory. All I'll say about it is that, to the extent that these players and GMs exist, that minutia are important to have been created before play. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, this comes down to creative agenda. What is it that the players are trying to create? If it's actually this particular feeling of immersion, then they'll demand one sort and quantity of minutia. If it's about the players transmitting meaning, then it's important that the minutia get created through play, because, in fact, minutia can carry subtle meaning. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing more like Shreyas than being an immersion guy, I lean that way myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Chris used a good word: Acrete. For the sort of play that we have, the things that are created to support play have a weight to them. Meaning created in the context of those other things that have meaning for us is greater than those things created out of the blue. And so you acrete layers of minutia, one upon the other, as you go along adding things that matter to the players. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis, too, has the benefit of efficiency. With the immersive model, the problem is always that you create material that ends up not getting used, since it has to pre-exist "just in case." Of course, for the designer of such material, the design itself may be enjoyable, and so this may not be a chore. I think that I often come down on the side of acreting in play because I simply don't want to put the time into doing more minutia creating. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause, yeah, I too have been that guy who creates a lot of minutia. Probably not as much as many, but that's because I've never put a ton of effort into preparation. But I have done some, and it was all in the name of trying to have a world with some depth to it. Whether that was facilitating things or not. The act of creation, even on one's own, is fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83598/#Comment_83598" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T05:55:53+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  5:55AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am, I am, I cop to it.  I used to be pretty hardcore about it, but my obsessiveness has diminished as the games I play and the style in which I play them have both changed.  I still love adding little stuff that matters, infill that can be used.  I recently ran a TSOY session that included the battle of Shiloh.  I figured it wouldn't hurt to know who actually <i>fought </i>in the battle, so I looked up the units and commanders on both sides.  Turns out the player characters ended up fighting with the 16th Kentucky, and now our group has an affinity with the men and officers of that unit.  When somebody invokes Secret of Contacts, it's an easy draw.  It could have been anybody, a made up number, but investing a tiny bit of minutae has made the game world a little more solid, a little richer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83602/#Comment_83602" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T06:18:37+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  6:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, well, see now, you've opened up a whole new can of worms... how much detail is needed in a historical game?

Certainly everybody has use for specific details of the setting that forward their creative agenda.  That's a given.  I'm curious if there are folks who have an appreciation for minutiae in and of themselves, folks for whom the minutiae is part of their creative agenda, not a supporting element.<br/><br/>I'll point fingers.  From what I've read, it seems to me that Jim Pinto, S\xc3\xa9bastien (pells), Jason Morningstar, and Shreyas are pretty solidly in this camp.  These guys like their details, their visceral experience, their texture, and while they have found these things to be useful in forwarding stories or motivating characters, <em>I think</em> they like them just on their own, too.  I'm not these guys, though, so I of course can't speak <em>for</em> them.  Hence the questions.<br/><br/>The eventual destination I'm working towards is a different kind of game structure.  Consider the 'basic' indie game to have a structure that emphasizes the <em>story</em> and builds it with minutiae (and game mechanics, and social interactions, and a number of other things).  How many indie games define the basic thrust of the story and then exhort the players to make up appropriate details as they go to support that story?  Now, consider a game structure where the emphasis is on the creation of minutiae and then finding useful applications for it (story, character, setting, political statement, whatever).  The game is <em>about minutiae</em> in the same way that an indie game is <em>about story</em>.  At least, that's the theory.<br/><br/>The question, to me, is if there's actually a demand for this sort of structure or if I'm barking up the wrong tree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83662/#Comment_83662" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T09:58:29+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  9:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be very interested...<br/><br/>Here are some links to previous story-games discussions that are on similar topics:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2814&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Against Worldbuilding</a> - the people that don't like highly detailed worldbuilding outside of a narrative weigh in against them as do.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2835&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Historical Roleplaying</a> - the connection already noted by many in this thread.<br/><br/>There's more to my love of highly detailed settings than just verisimilitude, I am still working on getting thoughts into order.<br/><br/>Suffice to say that "it depends on the game" is a big part of this, as Mike H. points out, but I am trying to figure out how it depends on the game and what game depends on what. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83674/#Comment_83674" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T11:15:35+00:00" title="July 27, 2007 11:15AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the group would kind of end up with an old-school sourcebook?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83678/#Comment_83678" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T11:29:22+00:00" title="July 27, 2007 11:29AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sort of -- although I'm thinking more in terms of hypertextuality and multimedia.

In fact, without the minutia that comes up in the context of play it's almost impossible to explain why a Contact ritual is, in fact, a conflict and not just a pass/fail task.  But even there the character and plot impetus comes *first*.<br/><br/>Josh, you're talking about a game where the primary activity is making up details and then perhaps fitting them into a story or a larger context.  A game where I, as a player, might say, "I'm thinking of a man in top hat and opera cape.  His round glasses glint in the moonlight.  He carries with him a gold pocket watch with odd engravings and a sword-cane with an elaborate silver handle."  But who is, what he's up to, that might come later, perhaps even much later when while doing something else entirely someone else might say, "Hey, Hey!   Remember the dude you mentioned with the top hat and watch and cane?  Yeah, Yeah, he totally belongs HERE!"<br/><br/>For the record, I would hate this.  I think I might literally go mad.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of one of the times I was playing WoW and I was flying somewhere.  You were standing over my shoulder and you pointed to some large statue on the ground.  You asked, "Don't you want to go there?"  It took me a while to figure out my answer but it was, "Not without understanding my role in being in there."<br/><br/>I am also reminded of line in Sorcerer &amp; Sword where he talks about the character generating and wearing the setting.

Could he show up without his cane and that not be significant?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85442/#Comment_85442" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T17:21:36+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  5:21PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really depends on the property. I can dissect The Wire for hours, seeking the meaning behind every single look and scowl, trying to understand how all the pieces fit together. I've watched and figured out The French Connection scene by scene. I know the Earthsea Cycle backward and forward. I like to read books about things like, for example, engineering in antiquity, the development of the idea of zero, the significance of the introduction of the stirrup to Europe at the end of the Migration Period, the last judicial duel in France. I tend to not like movies that are adaptations of novels because they get the details wrong.<br/><br/>What can I say? I'm a nerd. I like details and minutiae.<br/><br/>But I don't obsess either. In my gaming, the details color and add luster to roles and actions, but they are not equal to them. If I were telling the story of what is happening in one of my games, I might give you a few details to help you get the feeling of what's going on, but the main thing I would focus on would be the roles and actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
