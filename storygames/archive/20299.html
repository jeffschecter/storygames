A milieu, social or topological.<br/><b>Monstre</b><br/>A challenge. A foe or a trap or a "beast within".<br/><b>Tr\xe9sor</b><br/>A motivation. A reward, an escape, an effected change.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dot your map (whether the map is spatial, social or situational) with these and connect them in many webbed and non-linear ways and you're in for a treat of varied play with surprising outcomes.<br/><br/>In French, the term porte-monstre-tr\xe9sor has connotations of hack-&amp;-slash mindlessness, unsofisticated, pointless play. However, my position is this: It's a form of play that works. That's functional and coherent.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447434/#Comment_447434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T06:49:08+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  6:49AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 6:51AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Historically, I think the misstep was adding narrative, arcs, story beats and events to this. It's understandable that the early roleplayers wanted cooler stuff to happen. Things that they had seen in movies.<br/><br/>But I think the missing ingredient for that wasn't a narrative frame. Rather, it was motivated, conflicted and flawed characters, with real agency. A linear pre-planned plot collided with such character design and we got the age old arguments.<br/><br/>So while porte-monstre-tr\xe9sor is a great guide to the DM's part of the prep, the PC design are gonna have to bring it in order to get to great <em>play</em>.<br/><br/>This is re-treaded ground, I know. I just want to get it out there concise and understandable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
