As for sites, so far the only one I've found that comes remotely close to CCG development is <a href="http://www.lackeyccg.com/forum/index.php?sid=cf79067cad8ecc3e1225e7bdd83c2af7" rel="nofollow">Lackey CCG</a>.  The thing is though, it looks like they're somewhat tied to some software which allows for online play (which is a good place to start, but not necessarily what I'm interested in), and also many of the people who participate there seem like they are pirating art to use on their cards.  None of them are publishing these for profit, but I still don't like it when people use others' work without their permission and even less with propper attribution.  Still, it's good to see what other people are doing.<br><br>Also, Fred Hicks made an interesting post on his block recently about printing PDF cards.  He found that the respondants liked the idea of printing them out on perferated business card stock so they can be easily cut out and played with.  I'm not sure how I feel about that, but it is a good idea. But other than that, it's pretty dry from what I've been able to find.

Neither of those games are in any way "collectible" nor do they really promote "trading" either: in the former, you get all the cards in one purchase; in the latter, you make up your own cards, including art, using some kind of points buy system. OK, fair enough, IA could be "traded" because one might choose to trade rather than have to redo it in ones own iArmy Builder; hhow's that any different from (say) trading a PC one designs or trading some module one's written?<br/><br/>As far as I can figure it, to do a true T/CCG--rarity, boosters, starters, etc--you need to either:<br/>a) Hemorrhage money at start-up.<br/>b) Develop a database -&gt; PDF tool (as I mention above) and persuade a short-run or POD print provider to use it to generate your boosters and starters.<br/><br/>Any other type of product is not a T/CCG; it's a "card game," pure and simple, no different from Munchkin.<br/><br/>**All Hands Stand Down From Pedantry Alert**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114047/#Comment_114047" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T09:16:58+00:00" title="December 13, 2007  9:16AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Um...wanna do more than just a drive by post?

Haven't we been copying M:tG for long enough? Aren't the financial constraints on you as an indie-gaming publisher worth embracing, and exploring, to maybe find new forms of gameplay and meta-gameplay that are somewhat different from the CCG model but maybe just as compelling?<br/><br/>I understand how cool it'd be to have some way to do a "real" CCG on the fly... but I think there may be other models under our noses if we look for them.

I'll try to break it down without transcribing the MS Access Help files. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Your current process for POD cards would take a single PDF from a designer, store it on your file server, and send it to print when you receive an order, ya? Update to the PDF is just a matter of replacing the one on the file server.<br/><br/>OK, the DB -&gt; PDF process is functionally IDENTICAL to that, with only a difference in interface. Instead of grabbing a PDF and (metaphorically) passing it through to your printer; you open the DB and press "Make A Booster" or "Make a Starter". Then, the entire query engine would randomize--both within the whole set AND for commonality AND for current total count, at the same time--and pass that to a report. The report, in turn, would format the data (stats, text, art, attributions, whatever) onto *whatever* layout you require for your printing and dye cutting process. Out spits a PDF, which you pass to the printer; and even that could be automated, if the PC running the DB has the printer as its default Network or Local printer. BAM! Randomized cards, from the whole set, fitted to your mechanical requirement, and counted out for the purposes of making sure (say) each rare card is equally represented (or not).<br/><br/>It would be truly a waste of everyone's time to have the game maker hand-manage that process from home, e-mailing individual booster or starter sales to you, to pick-up and run through your printer and packager(s).<br/><br/>SO, is that easy? Well, hell, no. It's a fairly significant bit of query work, for instance (tracking output, in particular; randomizing numbers is easy) and getting the report(s) to fit right would take trial and error. Then, of course, there's the designing and balancing of 200-300 cards; working out pricing for your 18-card boosters (say) and for your 54-card starters (say); and sleeving or boxing.<br/><br/>But you wouldn't ever be hand-sorting (*shudder*) or somehow "caught out" by a report not working with your process (well, no more than someone's static PDF sheets would, at least). Want to change a card? E-mail a new DB table and overwrite the old one (or e-mail new card art, to replace old art in the folder structure from which it is called--wouldn't want to embed the art in the DB, just to avoid bloating).<br/><br/>Finally, you seem to think "installing" a database is somehow hard. Got Office? "Installing" means copying a MDB file and some art files; open the MDB and, if it's well-written, all you see are the two buttons above (and maybe an admin login option, to do on-the-fly changes outside of Access itself).<br/><br/>In fact... you might consider adding this as a future service, if you can find a good DB programmer (I am a "mere" architect). You could provide a "design" interface to game makers, with which they design card formats and stats and layouts; and the resulting tables could be sent to you, to be run from within a "production" interface, that pulls, randomizes, and PDFs them into your 3x3 sheets. Again, an even bigger job--the ability to layout the cards freely is a LOT tricker to code than a known layout for a single game--but what a killer feather in GoB's hat: the first TRUE POD CCG provider!<br/><br/>*stares wistfully into space* it's not... impossible....<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114080/#Comment_114080" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T10:19:51+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 10:19AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>What's going on in this thread, right now, this is what I want.

To get accurate front and back side printing and especially to get accurate die cutting, layout positions have to be precise.</blockquote>\nWell, Access reports can be laid out with a precision of, what, 1/100th of an inch? If that's not good enough, you're fucked anyway, I figure.\n<blockquote>Also, I can't see how it would be a good idea to make all the text editable and alterable, because that means not only would we have to position the cards at specific positions on a page, but we would have to position every text element.</blockquote>\nBut, no, you wouldn't. For every card, the report *IS* the layout of the card: art, text, numbers, icons--EVERYTHING has a location "on" the report layout. Don't think of a report as some banal list of records in rows: it can be laid-out in any format, pulling cards from the query (a card is a record of references to other tables, of strings, and or external calls for art).<br/><br/>For example, this might be a Magic card record:<br/>KeyID: 111999555 (or whatever)<br/>Name: Counterspell<br/>Card type: 5 (looks-up from "CardType" table to see that means "Instant")<br/>Casting cost: UU (parsed into "two blues" by query + lookup from "CastingCostTypes" table)<br/>Card text: "Counter target spell." (string)<br/>Artist: "L.A. Williams" (string, or could be look-up, for better structure)<br/>Rarity: 1 (look-up from "RarityType" table to see that means "Common")<br/><br/>Now, the record (PDF output) from that would be populating fields on the record layout... and those could be anywhere. They could even change in reaction to some of the data (ex: blue background JPG, for Counterspell, because it's two blue to cast).\n<blockquote>Further, that means companies would all be stuck with the same card design, essentially. Because to have different designs would be a reprogramming of the positions for all the card elements onto the sheet.</blockquote>\nYou're not taking it far enough. Yes, one could twiddle the data tables and the record layout (and impacted queries) and make a new database.<br/><br/>But what if, as part of the overall database interface, those very setups and designs are part of the DB, the part that a customer of yours would get, to "setup" their card game for this system. THEY do the "programming"--which would really be more like typing and drawing in a WYSIWYG layout program, ideally--and you just take the tables, queries, and reports that this "design" tool generates. Plug. Press GO.\n<blockquote>And while yes, that would be possible, I'm not really sure its practical for a POD card printer to be charging a $1,000 to $2,000 programming set up charge for a new game to be set up in the system.</blockquote>\nNo, see above.<br/><br/>Plug. Press Go.\n<blockquote>I think it would be far more practical simply to design a randomizer that could pull high res tiff card images and plop them into the proper place on the sheet for printing. Then clients would simply upload all their card images into a profile through the internet.</blockquote>\nOh, sure, that would always work fine.<br/><br/>And a hybrid would work fine, too: have those card TIFFs be singles only, but sorted into folders by rarity. Then, the DB could still do the randomizing-by-rarity, individual card count insurance (query) and layout to the page (report), but the "data" backend would be a mere table of card folder and file names from which the query plucks files references, to build up a random sheet.\n<blockquote>And done this way, a publisher could establish any rarity level they wanted for each and every card. There wouldn't just have to be commons, uncommons and rares. Each and every card could have its own frequency set.</blockquote>\nUm... not really.<br/><br/>If you randomize, you randomize. The only way to ensure "frequency" of a given card using the above "list it multiple times to make it more common" method is to keep a count per card. Basically, you are quasi-random: you have to randomize ONLY from within the set of cards which have not yet been "hit" by a call to print them, until every card has been called once; then repeat. And the *real* bitch is even harder: even that "randomize once per cycle" process could--by very low probability--make a booster full of rares.<br/><br/>No, the algorythm for pulling cards by rarity and count is a bit more complex that "pick a random file name." It would almost certainly require a rather sophisticated query.\n<blockquote>And yeah, maybe this is something we could tackle in the future.</blockquote>\nFrankly, the hybrid solution should be all-but-trivial to roll out. No data backend to speak of; card appearances can vary wildly, even within a particular game (not to mention game to game); you don't have to program anything (after the initial DB setup) other than a card list table (i.e. cut &amp; paste from a directory listing in a command prompt). Talk the idea through with your SQL person--she (he? pronoun confusion above) can perhaps explain better than I how minor such a "pick and poke" DB query and report layout will be.\n<blockquote>However, one step at a time. First realize that while a CCG POD printing would be a mighty feather in the cap, there presently aren't any viable Card POD printers at all, so let's start from there and master that first.</blockquote>\nHey, not a problem. I can make no demands... just pointing out the only way I can see to do randomized POD (of anything, not just cards): with a DB. If someone wants to code anything from the "Killer Card Maker App and POD PDFer Backend" to the "Hybrid Pick and Poke DB" then they will enjoy all the benefits; I am but an adviser.<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114143/#Comment_114143" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T12:34:04+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 12:34PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            **Pendatry Triple Alert!!!

Stamps are "collectible" because one can't go down to the Post Office and buy a set of every stamp ever printed in every country in history.<br/><br/>A card product--sports, games, nudies, whatever--is also called collectible if it conforms to the same standard: one can't go out and buy them all at once in a set from the manufacturer. Otherwise, one could call Munchkin and Uno and even Standard Playing Cards collectible--a clear absurdity (<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>).<br/><br/>Now, you can try to use that phrase for a full-set product... and you will mislead customers just as you've (somewhat) mislead posters to this thread (me, at the least) by saying "CCG" and meaning a normal card game product.

Each card therefore has a 20% chance of being selected.  In a booster print, A gets selected, and its weight increases from 0 to, say, 0.1.  When the next print for the booster comes around, cards B - E have a 20.025% chance of being selected (the 0.1 from A divided 4 ways), and A has a 19.9% chance.

One isn't "collecting 2007 coins" if one buys the set, though one *is* "collecting coins". Basically, your coin/comic/sports card examples all shift the bar a bit, using the term in the sense of "collecting some" or a subset of an item as a counter to the (assumed) "collecting all" sense we'd been using.

At the moment I am looking to print a 60 card stand alone card game called 'Revenge of the B-movie'. You can see some of the cards here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.giantbrain.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Giant Brain website</a><br/><br/>I have had the game ready to go for about 6 months and the only thing frustrating me is a decent printer. This is what I have been through so far:<br/><br/><b>RapidPOD</b><br/>This was back in the Ken Whitman days and was a complete waste of time. Never got a sample from him and communication was awful. No idea about the new folks running it.<br/><br/><b>Avalon Innovations</b><br/>Gave me a sample from a chinese printer which was pretty terrible: thin cards, awful coating. Said they would try and find me another printer but I haven't heard anything in a couple of months from Lance Williams. That is depsite emails every now and again. Price wise for the chinese printer i was quote round about $1400. That did not include shipping to the UK.<br/><br/><b>Ivory Graphics</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.ivorygraphics.co.uk/playing-cards.asp" rel="nofollow">Website</a><br/><br/>These guys produce promotional playing card decks for companies. The quality of their product is good, if not casino quality, and their price is good as long as you are willing to print in decent amounts. For 500 decks the price is about \xa31400 which equates to about $2800 at the moment.  This is about \xa32.14 a deck which ain't too bad and will give me a decent profit margin if i sell them for about \xa310. Downside is they can only print 54 card games and rules have to come on cards as well.<br/><br/>Anyone else I have come across has just demanded too high a run. If you really want to go for it and print thousands you will have no problems tracking down a printer. If you want to print more modest amounts it is really tough to find someone who will print it and not take your house as payment.<br/><br/>Ryan I will whisper to you seperately but I have been keeping track of your posts on other places and am very interested in what you have to offer. Alternatively you can contact me through the Giant Brain site above.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114425/#Comment_114425" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T12:43:49+00:00" title="December 14, 2007 12:43PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>Please tell me that wasn't posted to suggest Time Walk was an over powered card?</blockquote>Not to derail the thread, and I agree with you in many ways; but it's an obliquely powerful card, nonetheless, and since you were playing when I was playing I'm sure you heard cries of foul when it was removed even as others were cursing its' existence. Same with Time Vault, then later Lightning Bolt, et al.<br/><br/>My big point was that card balance is all a matter of perception and anxiety about play control versus actual concrete effect; threads on Time Walk from the old dojo-era sites were all methodical discussions of balance, and came to no explicit conclusion. In essence, the card was removed, along with a suite of similar cards, to slow the game. Of course, it didn't work; but that's another thread entirely. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114433/#Comment_114433" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T13:24:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  1:24PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never missed the Timewalk when it went away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut man, that was cruel taking away the Chaos Orb. That thing was just fun to drop. It was especially fun working together with a Skull of Orm and a Copy Artifact. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, i think the best a designer can do is strive for card balance in actuality. Perception is something that players can only change with appropriate experience. It took a while, but I eventually got a lot of players in our local area to understand how essential card advantage became, which got them to take a fresh new look at the advantages of liabilities of chosing certain cards for their decks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome cards will seem very powerfully on the face of it, but not to experienced players who know better. The trick in design would seem to be not to design any singularly power enough card, no matter what its liabilities, that it frustrates players to the point of non enjoyment of the game. I really think that that factor more than its particular difficulties in playing against is what got Stasis on the restricted list back in the day. An aweful lot of deck types could run right through a status deck, mine included, but it just slowed the game down for enough non tournament players that it became not fun to play. Cards that make the game go into lock down and not fun should be avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

An update to the POD Card service we are looking to set up. Figured I would post it here rather than a start a new thread about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the opportunity recently to test my alternative paper stock. a 12pt Carolina cover stock, C2S (Coated 2 sides). Its gloss is less than the Kromekote Plus sheet, but that seems to be better for a number of reasons. I've shown the Kromekote Plus samples to numerous people and most thought the gloss was too much. The Carolina has less gloss and that is also helping with the "lightening" of the second side printing. Its still happening, but to a much less degree. Whereas with the Kromekote I was estimating a 10-15 lightening affect, now is maybe 5 or less. Still visually different, a tad, if you compare one printed 2 sides and you compare the same side printed one sided. But without that comparison to make, my guess is you would never know. This simply means, however, that on our end, we're just always going to have to print people's card backs first.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe initially had some positioning issues with trying to put 18 cards onto an 11' x 17" sheet (well, 9 cards onto an 8.5" x 11" sheet anyway) and ran into margin difficulties when trying to space the cards appropriately for the die cutter and leave in a tad bit of bleed. Having spoken with our paper distributor, we'll be able to fix this problem by ordering our Carolina stock in 12" x 18" sheets which will get rid of the margin issues. As such, anyone that thinks they will be interested in working with us once we're ready to go, I'll be able to provide you exact layout specs shortly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also had the opportunity to review our base pricing:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we are looking at is. All basic decks will come in a plastic tape sealed bag as part of its production cost. We'll be striving to stock a couple sizes to insure a reasonable tight fit. Additional packaging options will be separate.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Base Pricing.<br/>\n$.075 per 4/4 card.<br/>\nMinimum Order: 10 decks/sets, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) 50+ Decks/Sets<br/>\n$.07 per 4/4 card<br/>\n<br/>\n3) 100+ Decks/Sets<br/>\n$.065 per 4/4 card<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinting all B&amp;W saves just $.01 per card. Printing B&amp;W one sided and color on another saved $.005 per card.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will be doing drop shipping. Minimum order remains in effect. We'll warehouse the finished product. However, we don't care to warehouse huge amounts since we're not charging a warehousing fee, so maximum order for drop ship print runs will be 50 decks. Now, someone "could" print 100+ decks and have us warehouse 10-50 and have us ship the balance to wherever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll decks printed for drop shipping will carry an extra $1 cost for the drop shipping service. Card "packs" will be charged $.25 for drop shipping. Then anyone doing drop shipping will be required to establish a small "shipping fund" from which we will withdraw exact shipping costs per order shipped and the fund will need to be replenished when it runs too low or else we won't ship. We will only be shipping via USPS. It will be up to the individual companies to decide which USPS shipping options and add-on services they would require for each order.<br/>\n<br/>\nRetail Option:<br/>\nEach publisher will have the option if they chose to allow us to "retail" the product both through our B&amp;M store (just the one for now, more hopefully later) and through our e-commerce sites. This is by no means a requirement to doing printing with us. If you chose the retail option, we will print up additional copies of the product at our cost and more or less print them on demand. In other words, we'll print 2-4 extra copies up to inventory in-store and use that same stock to fill web orders. We can always print up more. For the retail option, we pay for the printing and packaging and then pay you a 35% (of MSRP) royalty when the product is sold. MSRP will be the same pricing you offer it through other channels and/or have listed as MSRP on your own online stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional Packaging Options:<br/>\n<br/>\nSingle Deck Box Packaging. 4/0<br/>\nPrice Per Box: $.40<br/>\nThis is a 4/0 tuck box that we can print on a 12pt stock, then die cut and score for folding. When order from us, they will come non glued. They can be taped along the seal edge or for a more professional appearance glued via use of a hot glue gun (very cheap and so is the glue). We will assemble for product inventories for drop ship (hence the extra drop ship charge per deck).<br/>\n<br/>\nExpansion Pack Packaging Wrap 4/0<br/>\nPrice Per Box: $.22<br/>\nThese will be printed onto a 10pt cover stock, then die cut and scored like the single deck packaging only rather than folding to form a "box", they serve to fold around a smaller set of cards to create a printed cardboard "wrap" so as to lay flat. These will be shipped flat as well. Can easily be folded and then sealed by tape, glue gun or simply be shrink wrapped to hold it closed. We will assemble and glue gun shut for drop ship orders.<br/>\n<br/>\nDouble Deck Box Packaging &amp; Wrap<br/>\nPrice Per Box: $.75<br/>\nThis box size is simply too big for a 12pt cover stock to serve as a viable box. The 12pt stock is just too flimsy to make a functional box. However, we can resell some of the blank boxes we have produced by the Guild's box manufacturer. We have a 5 3/4" x 4 1/2" x 1 1/2" blank tuck box on a 22pt chipboard with a smooth white facing that we use for some of our own small format boxed games. We then print a "wrap" that gets attached to one side of the box, wrapped around the box, then attached to itself. This box format is large enough to fit two decks of cards plus game rules, dice and maybe a few other flat objects. For this packaging you would get the blank box, lay flat (but already glued together) and then the wrap cut to size, but then would have to attach the wrap yourselves. Again, we would assemble for drop ship orders.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional Inserts:<br/>\n<br/>\nB&amp;W Rules Sheets: Single Sided: $.06 Double Sided: $08<br/>\nColor Rules Sheets: Single Sided: $.18 Double Sided: $.26<br/>\n7/8\u201d Red Plastic Chips: $.06 ea<br/>\n1 1/4\u201d White Plastic Chips: $.14 ea<br/>\nSix Sided Die: $.30 ea<br/>\nFour, Eight and Ten Sided Dice: $.50 ea<br/>\nTwelve Sided Die: $.55 ea<br/>\nPlastic Character Stands: $.15 ea (smaller circular stands)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the standard "bits" we already inventory for the assortment of games we produce. If there is enough demand for some other form of bits, we can investigate stocking them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're going to investigate possible methods that we can offer "display" boxes for single and double decks of cards as well. But most anything we can offer will probably include some sort of blank display box with some means of attaching printed artwork to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.
