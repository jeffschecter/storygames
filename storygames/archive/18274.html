The rule system is almost three pages long and presents how the game should be played in a semi-linear structure. I had in mind that the game master reads the text, either out loud for the others or silently, and then plays a section after reading it. But how should I do the layout (or typography) so that the reader understands that it's now time to lay down the manual and start to play? Do you have any suggestions of games that do this and do this well?<br/><br/>You can <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17608/this-is-pulp-the-structure-of-the-rulebook#Item_3" rel="nofollow">have a look at the rules</a> if you want a better understanding of how the game is written.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412029/#Comment_412029" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T00:50:43+00:00" title="April 15, 2013 12:50AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eppy's free-to-download tutorial for the upcoming <i>Swords Without Masters</i>, called <i><a href="http://dig1000holes.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/the-city-of-fire-coin/" rel="nofollow">The City of Fire &amp; Coin</a></i>, is sort of like that.

Several of those early 1980s boxed set RPGs had tutorial style modules in them.<br/><br/>Most were Choose Your Own Adventure style numbered entries with boxed text.<br/><br/>The much maligned Indiana Jones RPG actually set out the basic rulebook in a way that had players read some text, and then jumped to a chapter of an ongoing scenario with rules that had just been introduced. It didn't necessarily matter who'd been a PC and who'd been GM for the previous chapter.<br/><br/>Since your rules are so short and we live in the computer age when printouts are easy, is it possible to simply break the rules into sections and have each part of a tutorial on a page or half page, possibly with additional info on the back? It should give you plenty of space to work with that way, and each page could be numbered. Print the things out, pass them around, and start with step one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412057/#Comment_412057" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T11:21:36+00:00" title="April 15, 2013 11:21AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2013 11:42AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Since your rules are so short and we live in the computer age when printouts are easy, is it possible to simply break the rules into sections and have each part of a tutorial on a page or half page, possibly with additional info on the back?

The setup of the game could include laying all cards face down and then flip a card and follow it's instructions. There are fourteen headlines and I probably have to divide them into more headlines, perhaps twice as many. What would you think of an idea like that? I don't know if it's even possible myself. I would probably have to redesign parts of the structure to achieve that.<br/><br/>I will also look up the suggested games in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412115/#Comment_412115" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-17T06:02:27+00:00" title="April 17, 2013  6:02AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently reading through <b>The City of Fire &amp; Coin</b> - a game that one person should read a section out aloud and then everybody follows the instructions. One thing that strikes me is that there are examples in the text, which I feel I want to read aloud as well. I wonder if you really should have examples in a game that is played like this. It feels better to turn the example into an exercise. I have several examples in my text. Most are short sentences but one is an example on how to read the dice. I will turn that into an exercise instead. I will include the short examples into the structure of play as well. So the first time you play the game, you must include the sentences that I give as an example.<br/><br/>One good thing CoF&amp;C does is, in a natural way, making the GM presenting the game to the players. That's one thing that is rather weird in roleplaying and board games. The writer of the game should write it as how one person should present and explain the game to others.<br/><br/>The game does a good effort in repeating previous parts, which is something I will carry with me into my rules text as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
