I'm not that thrilled by the system, however. And though the high death-toll through backstabbing and framing as well as all the wacky comedy seems like it could be fun for a while, it also seems like it'd get old pretty fast. I wonder if we could tweak it a bit? Still keep some of the humor, but keeping it more... I'm not sure if tongue-in-cheek is the term... I'd like to make the game a bit more \xabStory Now\xbb, for lack of a better term. And I'd really like to simplify the rules quite a bit.<br/><br/>I'd like life and death to be less cheap, for characters to live longer, and get to explore Alpha Complex and the politics within to secret societies.<br/><br/>My best idea so far was to play Primetime Adventures with Alpha Complex as a setting. Maybe edges and relationships are replaced by your mutant power, your secret society, etc. <br/><br/>Or maybe I could use the Solar System. <br/><br/>But perhaps you have other, even better, ideas?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394035/#Comment_394035" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T22:37:00+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 10:37PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2012 10:37PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The obvious plug, first:  For playing the short game, <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/news/2012/06/15/a-very-special-paranoia-fiasco/" rel="nofollow">Fiasco is better than the original.</a><br/><br/>For the long game that you're describing...

Each players and the GM are writing rumors on a sheet of paper, and they put them into a box.

This is because I find Paranoia interesting specifically for how loose the situation is and how much room there is for exploration of different themes. Playing e.g. <i>My Life with Master</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i> would be a very defined slice with a predetermined viewpoint on what it's all about.<br/><br/>The original system or a sufficiently loose story game system like SS, on the other hand, enable you to retain a sense of dramatic tension: is this comedy, tragedy or drama, is this about secret society wars or bureaucratic kafka, does class society critique make an appearance, who makes the next punnish joke by introducing some farcical elements. And these aren't development choices in advance, they're constantly reappearing questions: will this scene be grim as hell or will it devolve into comedy? Solar System shines in these types of complex, organic weaves.<br/><br/>Yes, thinking about it, I think I'll add Paranoia into my roster of "SS campaigns I offer when players ask for SS". We just started a cyberpunk SS game that's been hanging around for a couple of years, so I could definitely add a new thing to the roster. I'll have to reread the rule book to decide whether I'd go with the original system, though; there's all sorts of excellent stuff that one could do with SS here, but I'll need to look at the original rules to decide.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_394718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394718/#Comment_394718" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T03:39:54+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  3:39AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to add my 2 cents, every game of Paranoia I have played where the majority played in first person survival mode has SUCKED! Because all the things the game encourages, such as backstabbing, hiding information, and taking no more risk than necessary, leads to inexpressive and BORING play. However, when people start playing in third-ish person irony mode, those same exact things can lead to engaging and even <i>humorous</i> or <i>tragic</i> play. It's the <i>emotional distance</i> between player and character which is important, but not too distant or else you end up with meaningless Zap style play, and that DOES get tedious real fast.<br/><br/>The current system does <i>nothing</i> to support any of this, and Perversity Points are a bolt-on which though useful should be less necessary than they are, and I think act as a quick fix. Fiasco would be a great base, but even that is too character distant for me. Out of every RPG I have played, Dying Earth / Skulduggery has led to the most humorous character focused sessions I have encountered, so I'd probably start there, because Paranoia has always been satire first and foremost for me. But honestly, ANY system other than its own is preferable AFAIC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394743/#Comment_394743" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T07:27:31+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  7:27AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for your input, and keep it coming if you have it.

I doubt that would change if you switch to a different set of rules.<br/><br/>Paranoia at its core is "System Doesn't Matter" par excellence. It's hard-wired into the whole set-up, setting and tone of the game. It's the games central conceit, actually. The fact that it's wrapped up in a satirical package just makes most people accept it more easily. <br/><br/>Paranoia is all about what the GM wants. It's about how you want to run the show/game and rewarding and punishing your players for appropriate and inappropriate behaviour. That can include non-traditional means (like verbal cues, use of props or just general LARP-style antics) as well as traditional ones (hard rulings, blatant favoritism, vocal enthusiasm).<br/><br/>Really, nothing in the rules is making you run Paranoia as a game where life and death is cheap, where characters don't live long and don't get to explore Alpha Complex or the politics within the secret societies. It's the complete opposite in fact. The rulebook is almost overbearing in the way it continually proclaims how the entire thing is completely in your hands. There is no system to get in the way or guide the game. It's all on you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394795/#Comment_394795" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T12:39:42+00:00" title="October 25, 2012 12:39PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Georgios, basically you're saying that Paranoia's system is perfectly fine because it doesn't actually exist. Meanwhile, Jumanji's premise was that he'd like to have a system of some sort to run the game with.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I agree with Georgios on what the game text says. However, the game is in some ways ill-served by this situation; my play experience tends to be that the GM fiat present in the game is a great joke and it does well in enabling the players to accept the arbitrary setting, but at the same time it greatly disincentivizes setting exploration in favour of arbitrary short-term comedy. That's just how it goes when players internalize the notion that their characters live and die for laughs, and those laughs are pretty much generated by the GM using GM powers. Of course you can do whatever you want in practice, but in my experience this is the natural outcome.<br/><br/>The interesting bit is that from a modern perspective there is not nothing in the setting and premise of Paranoia that necessitates the GM fiat; that part is just a throw-away joke, it's not integral to what the game is about. The only thing that the fiat gives you is the ironic comparison between the hapless characters and the equally so players, the former ruled arbitrarily by the Computer and the latter by the GM. The setting itself could be used just as well with empowered players who can join the GM in putting their characters into laughably tragic situations.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394800/#Comment_394800" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T13:26:34+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  1:26PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The interesting bit is that from a modern perspective there is not nothing in the setting and premise of Paranoia that necessitates the GM fiat; that part is just a throw-away joke, it's not integral to what the game is about.

I think it is absolutely integral to how the original Paranoia works as a game - and I consider it a triumph of design.  Paranoia is about power relations, and playing it is meta-reflective on this.  One could make a game that is about Alpha Complex, but I think Paranoia is interesting because it isn't about some distant setting or themes - it is all about player competition and GM authority.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394802/#Comment_394802" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T13:40:11+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  1:40PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>For what it's worth, I agree with Georgios on what the game text says. However, the game is in some ways ill-served by this situation; my play experience tends to be that the GM fiat present in the game is a great joke and it does well in enabling the players to accept the arbitrary setting, but at the same time it greatly disincentivizes setting exploration in favour of arbitrary short-term comedy. That's just how it goes when players internalize the notion that their characters live and die for laughs, and those laughs are pretty much generated by the GM using GM powers. Of course you can do whatever you want in practice, but in my experience this is the natural outcome.<br/></blockquote>\nI think that's the tragic misunderstanding that lies at the heart of a great number of "funny" but un-fulfilling games of Paranoia. Yes, it is a comedy game. But the humour doesn't have to come from the silly, blatant ways that the characters live and die at the whim of the GM.<br/><br/>Much like, say, the Coen film "Burn After Reading", the comedy stems from the f'ed-up nature of the situation; the grimness of the setting set in stark contrast to the incompetence and pettyness of the characters. <br/><br/>My most enjoyable and memorable games of Paranoia did NOT come from games where people internalized that their characters lived and died for a laugh. Those were some awfully stupid and silly games. Whenever I had players like that in my games, I tried to minimise their influence, because they would constantly steer the game towards some very hollow and dumb gaming.<br/><br/>Instead when played like a traditional RPG, with all the assumptions, expectations and short-term goals that it entails, Paranoia opened up beautifully and became this unfathomably hilarious game of petty bureaucrats, loud-mouthed buffoons and self-involved idiots.<br/><br/>I've found that the key to Paranoia was making sure you fight the assumptions and "internalised fatalism" that often accompanies veteran players new to Paranoia.<br/><br/>I can sort of see how Fiasco fits well with this tone and style. But by switching to something as free-form as Fiasco players don't get to experience this hilarious tension between doing what their gamer instincts tell them and realising that this will just exacerbate an already insanely convoluted situation. There's something about Paranoia's humour that really only works when you are a gamer; when you have certain assumptions and trained behaviour as to what it takes to "play an RPG". Al of which are beautifully upended in a well-run Paranoia game. When Paranoia actually clicks with a group like that, there's really nothing like it. <br/><br/>As far as I can tell, Paranoia is the only "roleplayer comedy" game out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394811/#Comment_394811" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T14:22:24+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  2:22PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My point about the GM fiat is mainly what Georgios laid out there: playing Paranoia <i>necessitates</i> fighting against fatalism and petty short-term comedy exactly <i>because</i> players are inducted into the game with the powerful message that this game is about arbitrary GM powers. He'll kill your character if you read the rule book, hah hah.<br/><br/>You could probably approach the game differently, and nowadays I would, but I think that it's pretty clear that the reason the game plays as chaotic comedy is because the players don't feel like putting serious work into characterization and setting exploration, and the reason they don't do that is because the game has been sold to them as an inequal power situation where the entire point is that the GM's going to unfairly hose you.<br/><br/>I do think that the setup has its virtues, and I wouldn't be averse to trying it anew (haven't played the game since the '90s). Just like Georgios says, I would put special emphasis on encouraging the players to take the setting seriously and play their characters with forethought and cunning. This would be a balancing act, as I would also want to retain the arbitrariness of the Computer's reign of terror.<br/><br/>And to clarify, there's nothing wrong with this being natural to the game. I just think that it would probably be easier to get over it and look at Paranoia as an interesting fantasy setting for other kinds of play if you used a different system to play it, one without the strong emphasis on GM fiat. I'm not convinced by the argument that the system is perfect for all kinds of play because the game is mechanically traditional and doesn't prevent you from singing opera librettos during sessions if you want to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394826/#Comment_394826" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T16:06:13+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  4:06PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Don't you think that the protagonist-friendly bias of TSoY (really, the system is rather rigged for the player characters to overcome obstacles and succeed and finally Transcend in the process) works against the "unequal power situation" presented in Paranoia?<br/><br/>I'm curious how you would handle this in the Solar System!

A good example to me is how R&amp;D works.  <br/><br/>From an in-character viewpoint, using the R&amp;D devices is almost sure to bring you grief, because they are poorly designed and insanely dangerous.  However, because they are character power options, role-players are trained to use them anyway - i.e. as if they were magic items or superpowers.  They are essentially a parody of magic items, and by being "special" (using game-assigned powers), characters get themselves killed.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394832/#Comment_394832" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T16:35:03+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  4:35PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John is right, of course - it would be a different game if you swapped out the system. That was the point of the discussion, right? What systems might be used instead of the original and why.<br/><br/>The way I envision using e.g. Solar System (Burning Wheel, even Dust Devils) for Paranoia would be to reduce the level of implied character immersion. I don't think that the themes of the game require <i>players</i> to feel feelings of futility and despair (which are the reason for how the game affects players, make no mistake - some feel these things, while others specifically block the frustration by focusing on superficial comedy). It would be quite OK for the players to play these sordid losers, made so by the social system of Alphacomplex, with ironic detachment typical of many dramatic roleplaying games. I suspect that a happy balance between crazy comedic moments and horrible dark satire would be easier to achieve if the GM didn't need to find that balance alone.<br/><br/>For example, what's wrong with the idea that your Communist traitor gets accused as such in one of those ad-hoc tribunals the Computer is so fond if, and we resolve this by entirely ordinary conflict resolution? Throw in some legalistic ability - speaking of Solar System here - perhaps support with computer logic (or whatever the English name of the skill is), see what the dice say. Seems to me that this could be potentially quite fun, in a different than if the players simply play-acted as hard as they cared and then the GM gave an arbitrary decision on whether your character gets to live another day.<br/><br/>Of course it would be a different game ultimately, as something like SS empowers characters as well as players. I don't find this a bug, it'd be interesting to have the slim possibility of redemption hanging as a carrot out there in exactly the way SS enables if you make sure to turn the screws as much against the characters as the system allows. Some of the original Paranoia material flirts with actual success, too, what with the various rebellion storylines. Now it'd just be the entire group determining whether the Computer can or should be taken down instead of the GM pondering over his bookshelf as to which story to run next for the players.<br/><br/>That being said, the player empowerment is more important than character empowerment here. I would totally go for something more desperate, too. The key is that the system is something that invites the players to explore the setting instead of punishing you for it. The reason for why I characterize the attitude of Paranoia as a thin joke is that it is genuinely a better read than play: the GM can appreciate how very Orwellian the game is, but does the attitude fostered by the game text really invite the players into the joke? My experience is that sometimes it certainly does, but far more often it seems that the only joke the players get is that the game is chaotic and irrelevant <i>because</i> it disenfranchices them.<br/><br/>Perhaps a comparison will clarify the point: <i>My Life with Master</i> would be exactly like Paranoia in attitude if the game did not presume player buy-in into the scenario. MLwM gets the buy-in by explaining the premise up front and by having the players design their own Master figure. Then play proceeds with a definite ironic flair as player characters get abused in heart-breaking ways: oh how awful things are being done to my character! If the game were handled in the Paranoia way, with the game text emphasizing GM/Master authority for comedic effect, it would be a different experience.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>After all that I'd like to again emphasize that I would totally be game for trying out some classical Paranoia out of the box, too. That system has virtues that you can't capture in a consensual cooperative game. For example, the fact that all characters have secret societies and mutations that are actually secret at the table, that's good fodder for asymmetrical tactical play. I believe that the Paranoia rules are intended for a sort of old school gamist play, with players using utmost cunning to survive and prosper in Alphacomplex; that would definitely be what I'd be driving at were I to play it now. Online play preferably, considering the challenges of running proper plotting face to face.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394834/#Comment_394834" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T16:40:12+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  4:40PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a Paranoia hack of <i>Cthulhu Dark</i> waiting to happen.

And I'd argue a less-skilled GM would go overboard and outright break them. Leading to the many Paranoia games where death is random, the GM is lying and makes arbitrary decisions and the mission is a hose-job. While those games are still Paranoia, they are kind of bland and tacky.<br/><br/>The key to running Paranoia is in the name. You want to make the players paranoid about their characters. If you put too much emphasis on the fatalism and helplessness of the players, then players will mentally and emotionally disengage from the game. It becomes a different game of Paranoia then. But if players are given too much influence over the game, they will at best affect an air of paranoia for playing their characters. Instead of experiencing an enjoyable tension within the game it skews closer to play-acting with a wink and a nudge. If that's what you're going for, then by all means Fiasco is probably the safest bet. It is far more accessible than Paranoia, gives players more room to contribute in any way, shape or form they feel comfortable with and just plays much faster.<br/><br/>And from what I can tell, Graham's suggestion of hacking Cthulhu Dark might also work as it takes some of the creative weight off player's shoulders.
