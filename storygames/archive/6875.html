So the blog turned into <a href="http://www.amagi-games.com/" rel="nofollow">Amagi Games</a>.<br/><br/>And, at present, I'm tinkering with the site, trying to make it both pretty and high-utility.  So, I have some questions for whomever wants to play ball.  I'll note straight off that Search and a Tag Cloud are on my to-do list; my first attempt at installing search failed, like, badly.<br/><br/>1) Article font: Too small?  Okay?<br/><br/>2) The buttons on the right: Distracting?  Okay?  Could you tell they were button right off?  If the left-hand post lists got long enough to need archives, would just converting the lists there into buttons that snapped you to a full list of "articles in this category" (with sysnopses) be intuitive, or just annoying? (This would mean that you'd just have a panel of button on each side, and the current article, greet your eyes on arrival)<br/><br/>3) The ads: Too much?  About right?<br/><br/>4) The "advice" and "gambit" categories: Are these intuitive?  Any better ideas?<br/><br/>5) Just in case I'm missing something: Any other commentary?<br/><br/><b>EDIT:</b> Fixed link.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152991/#Comment_152991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T14:27:24+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  2:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) I would increase the size a little bit, but it does seem ok as it is.<br/><br/>2) They do not look like buttons in a traditional way, but it is kind of intuitive to know they link to somewhere else.<br/><br/>3) The general design is very clean and simple, so the ads look ok.<br/><br/>4) "Advise" is. "Gambit" could be somewhat confusing. I love the name, but to make it more intuitive I'd use something more classical as "Optional Rules", "Modular Add Ons" or something like that.<br/><br/>5) The icons for the right buttons couls use some integration in style (other than color). I mean, we have a very neutral table, a very nice runic thing and several very modern looking icons... Perhaps using some base shapes that could be used as modular graphic elements...

Cost-wise, that's supercheap.  (As a comparison point, to put a standard banner on RPGnet, at the page top, with no moving media, is $1 per 1000 views; the ones you normally see there are oversized and animated banners, which cost...  more, there).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Wine is nice.
