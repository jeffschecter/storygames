I think the most obvious things are that I think in story mainly in terms of conflict, and when framing scenes I'm trying to think of the coolest thing that could happen, or the worst thing that could happen.<br/><br/>Who else has had similar experiences?

Especially when the non-writing activities are easier or more immediate or more fun.  There's just no payoff for me to sit down and write something, with all the attendant editing and hand-wringing over quality and hours staring at the screen, if I can simply exorcise the idea in our weekly game over soda and chips instead.<br/><br/><br/>More in line with your first question, all the benefits for me flowed from fiction writing (and reading, for that matter) into gaming, not vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176443/#Comment_176443" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T14:18:37+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  2:18PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you both:<br/><br/>On one hand, the ability to create stories collaboratively and with friends pretty much removes any "itch" I have to write stories on my own. I have enough lonely, tedious activities that occupy my time.<br/><br/>On the other hand, designing and thinking about story games has undoubtedly very, very determinedly changed they way I *would* write a story these days.<br/><br/>Some key points:<br/><br/>* Be aware of the "point" of any scene or bit of a story. Is it moving something along? Is it creating a mood? Is it creating conflict?<br/><br/>I think that before, I would tend to write long descriptions of things and try to capture a certain written style, not noticing that I wasn't creating any actual _story_ while doing so.<br/><br/>* Start with strong characters and motivations instead of trying to "plot ahead"<br/><br/>It's more interesting to find out how things turn out by throwing motivated characters into new and suprising situations than to try to pre-create a "plot" and then carefully fit the story into that box. <br/><br/>* The discovery of surprising facts/informations or interesting settings does not suffice. A story should be about someone and their decisions.<br/><br/>* Awareness of theme helps me figure out what interesting stuff is going on in my head and then get it on paper. As opposed to envisioning how cool it would be to have the Baron betray his wife, I can look to add stuff that will push harder on the premise/theme, getting more of that imagined coolness into the actual story.<br/><br/>* It's possible to create cool stories from simple (or even arbitrary) setups, as opposed to starting with some brilliant inspired idea. Lots of situation builders, etc, from story games do this really well. For a writer, though, this can be eye-opening: I've shared some of my brainstorming techniques for story games with fiction writers and they've been blown away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176452/#Comment_176452" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T15:04:24+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  3:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best games for me are the ones that help me practice improvising stories.

I'll be really interested in how my skills have developed during this time; I guess I'll get to see it when I take the time from games stuff to write fiction again. At least I imagine that my work habits and discipline have improved during these years, so perhaps I'll be able to finish a full novel the next time I'll start one. Thinking up ideas and plotting fiction has always been a strong suite for me, so I don't know off-hand whether the Forge rpg thing has outright improved my work in that regard - but I do know that getting involved in games has matured my skills and given me perspective on what is worth writing and what isn't; many stories are better off as rpg material, and in this world of too much art it's no mean feat to have a realistic picture of what one should work on seriously and what to save for idle entertainment.<br/><br/>To illustrate the opposite view from Brennan, one thing that might happen is that I'll be focusing more on the things that literature can do and that are difficult for rpgs, such as deep characterization and painting with words. Plots, bangs and drama come so easy in rpgs that I might concentrate on other things when I next put pen to paper in full seriousness. I know that the smaller works I've done now and then during the last couple of years have been all about poetic color and cultural identity, things that are rarely dealt with in rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176471/#Comment_176471" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T16:16:07+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  4:16PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In A Wicked Age helped me identify problems in a short story I was wriiting.

So when I looked at this story, which was reasonably well constructed but which I just didn't engage with, I thought "Hey, she can't get on the Owe list."  The problem was that the 'protagonist' was so passive I was getting more interested in side characters.  In other stories I've had godlike protagonists, and I thought "hey, how are these guys interesting?" but the reason those stories work is that the protagonists can shatter cities, but they want much more human things that they can't take by force (love, respect, family).  Make sense?<br/><br/>As for story-worthy situations, I've tried a few different methods using In A Wicked Age oracle elements as writing prompts.  At first I tried just oracle elements, found them stale, then did oracle elements and best interests, found them pretty good, but lacking in detail.  So now I'm trying oracle elements, best interests, particular strengths, and details... basically creating tiny scenarios as writing prompts.  The moral of the story is that IAWA does a really good job of prompting excellent stories, either at the table or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176532/#Comment_176532" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T06:23:12+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  6:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Ryan.

I used card names, pictures, flavour text, even mechanics where it made sense, using different card types as different elements (holdings as location, personalities and followers as characters, actions as scenes etc. for those familiar with the game). <br/><br/>I think that was quite similar to what you've been doing with IAWA and I too found it very useful to create situation and also to add constraints to what I might write, which in many ways was more important than the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176667/#Comment_176667" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T04:53:35+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  4:53AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2008 4:56AM by Ry.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: started a new thread                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
