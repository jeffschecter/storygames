Recently one of my friends wanted to run some D&amp;D 3.5 for us, and I saw this as a change to relive my old passion.<br/><br/>A very important element for me when I make a character is to draw the character. For some reason it is very hard for me to play a character if I can not visualize him/her. But it is also a long time since I have last drawn an elver, so it was a lot of fun to try to do that again.<br/><br/>It is always fun to try to figure out how you want some fantasy creature to look. I have never really liked how elfs was drawn by most of the artists in the old AD&amp;D, where they normally looked just like humans but with pointing ears. Not that I want to go into a discussion about how you should draw a fantasy creature, I just think it should be possible to make a bit more out of it, to make it more interesting.<br/><br/>So here is the process I went through to realize my version of an elver on paper.<br/><br/>The first thing I did was to draw an elver in the style I used back in my early days of roleplaying, just to get a feeling for it again.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/elf-fun/old-ver.png"/><br/><br/>My style has developed a lot since then, so there was a lot of things I wanted to change so it fit better with my current vision.<br/><br/>I started by working with the eyes. I wanted them to be more cat-like, but without them looking too much like animal eyes. The first tests I did turned out to look a bit too human:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/elf-fun/test-eye.png"/><br/><br/>But I could begin too see that to get larger eyes it is also necessary to have larger cheekbones so there are room for the eyes. That gave me the most important piece of the puzzle. Now I could get to something which was more what I wanted:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/elf-fun/nice-versions.png"/><br/><br/>Another thing which helped a lot to get the right look, was to make the chin more pointing - and of course the ears.<br/><br/>I then made a quick sketch to experiment with hair style and outfit, and try to see if I could get the same look while drawing a bit more loose:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/elf-fun/expt.png"/><br/><br/>After that I could finally jump to the final stage and actually draw my character:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/elf-fun/elf_dd-clean-small.png"/><br/>(<a href="http://anders.blimmer.dk/Images/elf-fun/elf_dd-clean-scale.png" rel="nofollow">Larger version</a>)<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I would really like to hear other peoples thoughts on visualize fantasy creatures (particular elfs), especially if you have some artwork too.<br/><br/> - Anders                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
