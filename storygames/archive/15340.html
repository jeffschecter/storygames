And maybe when it's done, you become friends! <br/><br/>Like speed dating except in RPG form. Or like how fantasy / science fiction allow us to talk about touchy subjects wrapped in an awesome / safe wrappers, except in game form and replace touchy subjects with friendship. <br/><br/><b>Level Up:</b> if the game doesn't just reward you for making friends BUT to become super awesome in the game, you need to play it with more people, and possibly make more friends. <br/><br/><b>Level Down: </b>Of course this might explode into having too many friends and you unfriend everyone and blame Story Games!<br/><br/><b>Achievement Unlocked:</b> If you can play this game with just 2 players or as many as 6+!<br/><br/><b>Bonus XP:</b> If the game is appropriate for any reasonable age level. <br/><br/><b>Why John?</b> You have too many friends, what is your super secret agenda gotcha motive?!? I run gaming events for lots of people, some friends, some strangers. People want to make friends. I want to help them make friends (even though that often means they come to less events because they have too many friends). So help me, help other people.<br/><br/>What game does this?<br/><br/> OR<br/><br/>Who is going to make this game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348321/#Comment_348321" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-08T10:35:05+00:00" title="November  8, 2011 10:35AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be the first to state the obvious.<br/><br/><i>Breaking The Ice</i> does something like this. It isn't just a romantic game. It's a game that deliberately gets the players to exchange personal details, preferences and so forth. It also gets them to swap places, in some way, so they get to see each other's viewpoints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348333/#Comment_348333" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-08T12:38:54+00:00" title="November  8, 2011 12:38PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An alien hive mind has kidnapped you all to explore the possible advantages of independent consciousness.  They quickly assess that you are, indeed, better than they are at coming up with varied responses to situations.  At the same time, they feel that your individuality is a hopeless liability for efficient cooperation.  They're about ready to end the experiment and dispose of you all as an interesting but ultimately unfeasible model for society.
