The first official task we were given was to Dresden-up a city using the city rules. This is at about the 75% done stage, but I'm excited and want to share. I should note that I have not read a single Dresden book and only watched the show a couple of times, so some of what I have here might not be totally in theme for Dresden. Please take such failings as my own, and not as those of <a href="http://evilhat.com/" rel="nofollow">Evil Hat</a>. Here it is:\n<p>Aspects</p> <ul><li>Corruption at every level</li><li>A new day is dawning </li><li>The Riots hang like an ancient curse</li><li>Former industrial hub</li><li> Extreme poverty</li><li>Hub of transportation and commerce</li><li>Black wizards' haven</li><li>There are gateways, then there are Gateways </li><li>Mainstream religions are infiltrated </li><li>Rich mystical ethnic traditions</li><li>Abandoned by The White</li></ul> <p><b>Who cares about the city?</b></p> <p>After decades of neglect, The White Council sees the error of its ways and wants back in to the city. In their absence, black wizards have formed a cabal--Feiticeiro Negro --too strong for the Council to eradicate easily. On the other hand, the lack of meddling by the Council has allowed the Fellowship of St. Giles to gain a foothold; the neglected finding home in a city of neglected people.</p> <p>Overall, dark forces are drawn to the city for the way it breeds and sustains human misery. All three vampiric courts hold sway, and major demonic activity seems to be drawn to the "gateways" that give the city its name. Faeries, meanwhile, are not very common. This may be due to the heavy influence of industrial production in the city's development.</p> <p><b>Who keeps the peace?</b></p> <p>Newark is kept from exploding by mutually assured destruction. While there are many extremely powerful corrupting influences in the city, they must carefully keep the Accords with one another lest the good times come to a sudden and complete halt. It is said that the '67 riots resulted from one side or another momentarily gaining a monopoly on power. The city almost tore itself apart then.<br/>\xa0<br/><b>How do mortals cope?</b></p> <p>As the established mainstream religions are so thoroughly coopted, mortals have turned to the rich folk traditions which have been allowed to flourish among the many insulated ethnic communities in the city. There also appears to be some hand at work trying to protect the citizenry: do the streets flood after rains because there is no money to deal with the problem, or to give mortals some running water to hide behind? Were the riots a hell-spawned paroxysm of hatred, or were they a cleansing fire which wiped away even worse corruption?\xa0</p> <p><b>What interests a supernatural tourist?</b></p> <p>Gateway City is aptly named: Newark is riddled with gateways to the Nevernever. However, few of these gates are permanent. Rather, many appear spontaneously and flicker out just as swiftly. The few permanent gateways are jealously guarded and often secret.\xa0</p> <p>As below, so above: The network of railways, airlines, and shipping containers that pass through Newark have a great deal of utility to denizens of the supernatural world, both as powerful concordances for magic having to do with passage and transference, and for more mundane concerns which even the unearthly require.</p> <p>Many also come to Newark in search of the kind of black arts, mere curiosity about which would ordinarily bring hard questions. The presence of this darkness also draws those who feel the need to act against it; many use Newark as a training ground for those who wish to hunt evil and some seek the most powerful foes out of Quixotic nihilism.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124332/#Comment_124332" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T11:28:51+00:00" title="February  4, 2008 11:28AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

I did try some of the Google search terms you suggest, but only X + prostitution yielded anything, though it's not present in this bit here.<br/><br/>Oh wait, no. I'm telling lies. The "Who cares about this place?" stuff was totally inspired by the book and forced me to write up what I had and then that crystallized and in some cases fed back into the Aspects list.<br/><br/>I think the real meat of the book-derived stuff will come when I try to tackle Aspects, Elements, and Contexts.

Even thinking about doing so brought a bunch of ideas to the fore, then actually doing so produced a wealth of information. I'm not sure how much of that got into the Aspects I've created thus far, but I expect it'll be useful in the future.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the layout of that chapter so far (and keep in mind, this is a super-mega-early draft which is in no way ready for publication, so I offer this solely as a fresh-eyes way of helping the Evil Hat guys out) lead me to believe that I should be coming up with some Aspects early on. Now I think that the entire process was supposed to lead me to come up with a bunch of junk, then refine that into a list of Aspects. I'm also not sure how many Aspects I'm supposed to come up with for the city. I think it would be helpful, in the final book, to have something like a flow chart or worksheet that leads you through every step of the process. I should also mention that I need to do a careful re-read of the chapter to make sure there's not stuff I'm just missing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124968/#Comment_124968" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T11:38:52+00:00" title="February  7, 2008 11:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

At first I thought we were going to play Spirit of the Century, but lo and behold, they said they wanted to create Dresden characters. Ulp. I had not read many of the most important chapters. Moreover, as I was explaining the setting to two of the players, they decided they ALL want to play wizards. Double ulp. It was really ulp squared, because it was precisely the two most important chapters to wizards (supernatural stunts and spellcasting) that I had not read. But what the hell? Why not? I informed them of my unpreparedness and they were good with it.<br/><br/>They decide that they want to play White Council Wardens, sent in to root out the black wizard cabals that are rumored to be growing like a silent cancer in neglected Newark, NJ.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136114/#Comment_136114" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T09:17:34+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  9:17AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The characters:<br/><br/>Arnar Astridsson, played by Tom M, is an Icelandic wizard whose family were sorcerers in the Odinic tradition. High Concept: Runecasting Wizard. Personal Struggle Aspect: Loyalty to the White Council and Loyalty to Odinist Heritage. <br/><br/>Additional Aspects: Sins of the Father (Loyalty to Odinist Heritage), Called by the Runes (Loyalty to the White Council), Riddlemaster (Loyalty to Odinist Heritage vs. Loyalty to the White Council), Vengeance is Mine (Loyalty to Odinist Heritage), MISSING ONE ASPECT<br/><br/>Skills: Lore (5), Conviction (4), Investigation (4), Scholarship (3), Discipline (3), Craftsmanship (3), Alertness (2), Endurance (2), Survival (2), Deceit (2), Weapons (1), Intimidation (1), Presence (1), Might (1), Resources (1)<br/><br/>Languages: English, Old Norse, Latin, French<br/><br/>Stunts: Wizard Permission (-1), Soulgaze (-1), Wizard's Constitution (0), The Sight (-1), Evocation (-2), Thaumaturgy (-2)<br/><br/>Specializations and Foci: Not yet done<br/><br/>Refresh: 3<br/><br/>Phase 1: Born to a long line of Icelandic sorcerers, power passed through the male line, Arnar took his mother's name after his father, Ulfur, sacrificed some criminals to Odin. Arnar does not speak of his father and hides his relationship to him. His father has thus far escaped justice and gone into hiding. Aspect: Sins of the Father<br/><br/>Phase 2: Arnar becomes torn when runecasting tells him he must abandon his homeland and train with the White Council in the New World. Falur, his uncle and trainer up to this point, is furious and they part on bad terms. On ship to Nova Scotia, a Red Court vampire attacks him. While the battle was going badly, Victor Sigredsson stepped out of the shadows and magically killed the vampire. Afterward, he announced that he had been sent by the White Council to find and train Arnar. Aspect: Called by the Runes.<br/><br/>Phase 3: "Arnar Astridsson and the Riddle of Midgard." When a small fishing village is decimated by a mysterious force, Arnar sets off to investigate. His rune-casting leads him to a foggy inlet, where dwells a malicious sea serpent with a mania for riddles. Can Arnar outthink and out-riddle thins ancient evil? Aspect: Riddlemaster.<br/><br/>Damian's addition: Devlin meets Arnar while training and initially looks down on his Runelore, but eventually learns to respect it when he tells Devlin something that saves his life. Aspect: Respect for Other Traditions.<br/><br/>Martin's addition: The serpent's manifestation knocks Hudson out of control. It appears increased magical chaos hurts his sanity, and only through defeating the serpent can Arnar save him. Aspect: Outside Chaos Increases My Own.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Wester Hudson, by Martin G, is a tightly-wound wizard who is very by-the-book, all of which conceals a roiling pool of psychotic chaos underneath. High Concept: Thaumaturgical Tactician. Personal Struggle Aspect: Complete Control vs. One Step Beyond.<br/><br/>Additional Aspects: Early Childhood Trauma (One Step Beyond), Letter AND Spirit of the Law (Complete Control), Outside Chaos Increases My Own (One Step Beyond), Without Order There Can Be No Life (Complete Control vs. One Step Beyond), and Cockiness Begets Failure (Complete Control)<br/><br/>Skills: Lore (5), Conviction (5), Investigation (4), Scholarship (4), Contacts (3), Guns (3), Stealth (2), Alertness (2), Resources (2), Performance (1), Presence (1), Athletics (1), Endurance (1)<br/><br/>Stunts: Wizard Permission (-1), Soulgaze (-1), Wizard's Constitution (0), The Sight (-1), Evocation (-2), Thaumaturgy (-2)<br/><br/>Specializations and Foci: Not yet done<br/><br/>Refresh: 3<br/><br/>Phase 1: Wester Hudson was born into a reputable family line, but his parents' issues ended explosively, in a violent death he witnessed. Forced to live with distant relatives who shunned him, the family collection of magic paraphernalia was his childhood friend. Aspect: Early Childhood Trauma.<br/><br/>Phase 2: He spent his days learning what he can of magic within the White Council guidelines, which bring order to his mental state. He prays that his magic potential will manifest and he will restore the Hudson name. His first breakdown came at 13, under the pressure of a bully. In his frustration he evokes a powerful explosive spell, but his reason lets him direct the spell away from anyone. Instead he blasts a nearby wall, but the bully's legs are trapped by the debris. The kid survives but becomes crippled, giving Hudson serious guilt over the incident. His uncle decides to instill control on Wester so he doesn't have another outbreak. Aspect: Letter AND Spirit of the Law. <br/><br/>Phase 3: "Point Break": When Hudson finds a gaggle of novices, he tries to teach them how to untap their potential. But when a cult of Outsider worshippers try to tap the group's power to unleash its master, can Hudson prevent reality from breaking apart?<br/><br/>Tom's addition: Hudson comes to Arnar for help deciphering the cryptic writings of the Outsider cult. Aspect: Not yet determined<br/><br/>Damian's addition: Devlin is brought in towards the end to help take down the cult, but is also tasked to kill the kids if Hudson fails in his task. He refuses to do this, but doesn't tell Hudson. Aspect: Need to Protect the Weak.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Jake Devlin, by Damian T., is a hothead out to prove himself with big explosions, though he is secretly hiding a feeling that he isn't that competent. High Concept: Pyromantic Commando. Personal Struggle Aspect: Bombastic Overconfidence vs. Secret Feelings of Inadequacy. <br/><br/>Additional Aspects: Colonel's Son (Bombastic Overconfidence vs. Secret Feelings of Inadequacy), Faux Demon Slayer (Secret Feelings of Inadequacy), Vampire Hunter (Bombastic Overconfidence), Respect for Other Traditions (Secret Feelings of Inadequacy), Need to Protect the Weak (Secret Feelings of Inadequacy).<br/><br/>Skills: Conviction (5), Presence (5), Might (4), Endurance (4), Weapons (3), Athletics (3), Discipline (2), Rapport (2), Alertness (2), Contacts (1), Fists (1), Intimidation (1), Survival (1)<br/><br/>Stunts: Wizard Permission (-1), Soulgaze (-1), Wizard's Constitution (0), The Sight (-1), Evocation (-2), Thaumaturgy (-2)<br/><br/>Specializations and Foci: Not yet done<br/><br/>Refresh: 3<br/><br/>Phase 1: Grew up a military brat, always being told to do better. Before killing a playmate he's found by White Council wizard J. J. Baker and taken in. Aspect: Colonel's Son.<br/><br/>Phase 2: A demon comes to attack Devlin's mentor and is about to kill him. Baker is knocked unconscious and Devlin accidentally sets off one of his mentor's devices, destroying the demon. J. J. thinks he did it intentionally, but Devlin can't come to admit he wasn't powerful enough. Aspect: Faux Demon Slayer.<br/><br/>Phase 3: "Fire Break": Devlin heads on his first mission as a Warden to Brazil to fight the Red Court. But when his troupe is ambushed and he has to rescue the other Wardens, will his cocky attitude land him in more trouble than he can handle? Aspect: Vampire Hunter.<br/><br/>Martin's addition: Hudson is assigned to plan and coordinate Devlin's mission. Devlin's indifference to order disturbs Hudson, who fears the plan my fall apart quickly. Aspect: Cockiness Begets Failure.<br/><br/>Tom's addition: Arnar is assigned to craft protective runes for Devlin and his troupe. However, when he learns the mission is against Red Court vampires, he goes against the wishes of the Council by following along to attain vengeance against the Red Court. Aspect: Vengeance Is Mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136145/#Comment_136145" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T11:52:16+00:00" title="March 24, 2008 11:52AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/bleeder-badge.png"/><br/><br/><br/>This looks good.
