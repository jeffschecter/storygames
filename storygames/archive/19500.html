I'm organizing a small, one-day con focusing on story games. I've run many con games, but this time is different - no GM, shorter average running time, and heavily dependent on player contributions.<br/><br/>So how do you run (or facilitate) a story game with convention visitors, strangers who paid for the privilege?<br/><br/>And how do you set up the events themselves? In every con I've been to, people signed up for a specific GM and game, with the assumption that they would be provided with characters and a carefully planned plotline. I have something quite different in mind for this one, and I'd love some feedback:<br/><br/>Players sign up for a six-hour block (twice the usual length of a con game). They don't sign up for a particular game, but rather join a "player pool" and gain access to a GM/facilitator pool. Each facilitator comes prepared to run a variety of games, with a basic setup for each. For example, I might come to the con with a custom playset for Fiasco, a map for Intrepid and a kingdom outline for Kingdom. <br/><br/>Players can then choose facilitators, games, and other players in an organic fashion, and start playing. If a group wants to go through the full setup phase of a game, that's great -- but they can also use the pre-prepared games and jump right into the action. <br/><br/>When a particular game ends, the players mix back into the player pool and can find a new group for another game. Facilitators can join as players to round out the numbers.<br/><br/>Does this make sense at all? I'd really like this event to foster a sense of community among story gamers, and give them some kind of shared experience.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433643/#Comment_433643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T00:10:11+00:00" title="June 10, 2014 12:10AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Six hours seems a huge amount of time for a Fiasco game. I normally wrap a con Fiasco game up in about 3.5 hours.  <br/><br/>I'm a strong proponent of doing two episodes of Primetime Adventures in a four-hour convention block, but honestly I often can't quite finish the second if we do a from-scratch show creation, so six hours would be good for that.<br/><br/>A six hour block would be great for two or maybe even three chapters of In A Wicked Age!<br/><br/>Honestly I haven't had anyone be that interested in playing games with huge amounts of player contribution "from scratch". But if, for example, I half-generate a Primetime Adventures show (just come striding up to the table looking worried and saying 'my god, we have to do a zombie show or it's back to writing Good Morning Schenectady segments for you and my third ex-wife is going to get my Ferrari. And it has to have a schoolteacher character in it.' then suddenly everyone is alive with ideas and constructively solving the puzzle rather than looking uncomfortably at each other not knowing what to say.  <br/><br/>But probably this problem would be solved by making that the point of the whole convention and everywhere in the materials, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433645/#Comment_433645" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T01:08:57+00:00" title="June 10, 2014  1:08AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The big block of time is intended to allow groups to finish a game, break up, regroup with new players and facilitators and play something else.

Someone is responsible for running the pitch session. They call out for people who want to play stuff to stand in one area, and for people who want to run stuff to stand in a line across the front. The ideal candidate for the person running the pitch session is someone who can look at the group of people who want to play and estimate if there are enough people who want to run stuff that everyone who wants to play will get to play, and if not, the person running the pitch session knows who among the player group can be asked to switch over and run something. So that happens. The person running the pitch session says, "Hey Steve, we need more GMs. Can you run The Quiet Year like you did before?" Then when the line of people who will run stuff is a good size, they all pitch the game they want to run and say how many players they need. And then the person running the pitch session tells people to go to the GM they want to play with, and usually it just works out, like finding a seat on a Southwest Airlines flight. People realize there are too many at one GM, and find other games to play. Sometimes the person running the pitch session helps people find a game. Doesn't hurt to have one or two too many GMs so there's a few more player slots than the number of players, and then some games get run with fewer than their maximum players, and sometimes a prospective GM ends up playing some other game rather than GMing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433687/#Comment_433687" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T01:37:13+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  1:37AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my viewpoint, a six hours slot is awesome! Time to play a game to completion, no convention-play rush involved. Sure, we Italians do play most games at a slower pace than what's average for English-speaking people, apparently\u2026 But still, I love the 5-6 hrs play slots, in those choice few conventions which provide them.<br/><br/>Mingling and joining a facilitator in-between games might be nice social time, but also backfire and devolve into chaos and diminished enjoyment pretty easily. I suggest providing people with (optional) ways to sign up for a game in advance; ideally a multi-step system like this:<br/><br/>1. Have your facilitators split in two separate pools. Pool A is people with one-two specific games they really want to play (or demonstrate), so it's not unlike regular, old-fashioned convention GMing, except they don't come with a planned plot. Pool B, smaller, is handy co-organizers who are available to facilitate a wide spectrum of games.<br/><br/>2. Have a website or something with short descriptions of games (think back cover text): either all available games, or just games from facilitator pool "A". Allow people to sign-in for specific games via the website (or e-mail or whatever).<br/><br/>3. Print out your schedule as resulting from the website, including blanks for unreserved player positions, and display it for last-minute sign up. Ideally manage on-the-spot sign up yourself, rather than allow DIY.<br/><br/>4. Begin each play-slot with a muster call. Check for players who signed up for each scheduled game (both online and in paper). If any places are vacant, say so, so that any unsigned players can join in now. Then sent the group to a table. Repeat for next scheduled game. You should be done with this in 5 minutes, 10 if your convention is very large, and then most people (hopefully) will be able to start playing.<br/><br/>5. In case any players are left standing by now, it means they didn't sign up for anything, yes? Also that they didn't care about scheduled (A pool) games with vacancies. Have your B-pool facilitators round them up into reasonably sized groups (4-5 players including facilitator will work for most storygames).<br/><br/>6. Each B-pool facilitators sits down with their impromptu play-group, tells them about the games they're capable of running, has them vote which one to play. Then they start playing. They're playtime will turn out to be diminished by 15 to 30 minutes compared to "A" type, scheduled groups, but still aplenty.<br/><br/>I suggest being one of the B-type facilitators yourself. You B-facilitators may also want to take turns skipping play altogether to stay at the helpdesk and manage sign-up, in a busy enough convention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433689/#Comment_433689" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T03:35:55+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  3:35AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again everyone for sharing your experience!
