So far, I have 4 people trying to get into [the first scheduled game of Shock:] and <em>8</em> people trying to get into [the second one], and we've barely gotten the bulk of event reservations yet.</p>\n<p>Um; what can we do? DREAMATION is too structured to just "thrown extra rounds of the game" into the convention. Do you have a second (or even a third) GM who can take additional tables? Is there any way to raise the max number of players from 3?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>That is, with reservations still unfinished, I'm booked to 200% capacity. This is what my dad calls a "high class problem."</p>\n<p>It turns out that, for convention play, you really can't do 5 players (counting facilitator) easily in a game of Shock: never mind 9. So I'm coming to my community to ask for help.</p>\n<p>Is there anyone who will be at Dreamation who is confident enough to facilitate a game of Shock: at my back? We can put tables right next to each other so I can answer any rules questions, and we might even be able to do some cool, collaborative experimentation between tables. We can make a common world (not simple, but perhaps really fun), or we can take common themes and see how the groups address them differently, or we can run completely independent things.</p>\n<p>If you've got time, I'd want to meet with everyone who's helping, maybe go to lunch or something, and get us all up to speed and knowing what's what.(I realize that, given the kind of people who sign up for Shock: we're probably going out to lunch already.)</p>\n<p>What I'd need, given these numbers are:</p>\n<p><strong>8:00 Thursday (R103): one more facilitator. We'll arrange it so you and I can communicate easily.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>8:00 Saturday (R207): <em>two</em> more facilitators. This will be 11 people total, with the players and the three of us.</strong></p>\n<p>If you're already signed up, please let me know that if you'd like to help!</p>\n<p>If you were signing up to play with me, specifically, and you help by facilitating, we can arrange that for either this game or another time \u2014 I'm only actually scheduled at 8:00 PM Thurs-Sat. We can do something else off the books.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everyone!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120574/#Comment_120574" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T07:05:57+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  7:05AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll re-read the rules this week and do Saturday's game, Joshua.<br/><br/>No sweat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
