Despite all the many books and thousands of words written it seems to boil down to the following:<br/><br/><b>Say what your character does. The GM tells you what happens.</b><br/><br/>11 words! Everything else are just niggly details. Maybe the odd dice roll here and there but that isn't changing the core. <br/><br/>I know there is nothing Earth shaking in this but it's interesting how simple it can be stated. I was able to boil the basics of Engle Matrix games into just 44 words<br/><br/><i>Play goes around the table. Pick a character and say what happens. Move characters as you speak.<br/><br/>Interrupt at any time to challenge. Say what really happens. Both sides roll. High roll wins, re-roll ties.<br/><br/>You may make up to five actions a turn.</i><br/><br/>For sake of discussion, how much beyond beyond those 11 words have story games gone?

But I'll take it at face value.  From a functional view, we all know that "a roleplaying game is a conversation" so it's fairly easy to abstract a very small handful of simple rules we learned in kindergarten.  But from a structural view I can see quite a few atomic elements in the few lines you've written above:<br/><br/>- turns<br/>- picking a character / owning a character<br/>- narrative control<br/>- representation of movement<br/>- interruption/challenges<br/>- conflict resolution for narrative control<br/>- action costs<br/><br/>...each of those requires at least a sentence or two to explain it, and some of them require supporting mechanics.  Your <i>Engle Matrix</i> example parses finer than your <i>D&amp;D</i> example.  So how big is a "detail"?

That single sentence could be describing a line dance event as well as D&amp;D, pretty much.<br/><br/>(In case it matters, here's my D&amp;D definition as a handy-dandy buzz-word list: challenge-based adventure rpg with prepped scenarios, impartial referee, organic-realistic task-based conflict resolution, classes, levels, xp gain through mission success. Remove any of those and I don't think that it's distinctively D&amp;D any more. And yes, I accept that by my definition certain formulations of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> count as D&amp;D variants.)<br/><br/>As for the challenge of writing longer games, I would like to draw attention to a simple functional criterion here: if you can't play a game from a text, it ain't the rules for that game. You might have a superficial description of the game, but that's got little to do with its rules. I'm suggesting that this criterion should be applied to a text that is being presented as a condensed rules summary of a game.<br/><br/>This is significant, as it is immediately easy to see that yes, there are plenty of roleplaying games and story games out there that could not possibly be condensed to a word count less than a few thousand words at best. Even if we agreed that the "basic D&amp;D rules" boil down to that one sentence, it would be easy to see that progress has indeed been achieved in writing lengthier, more complex games.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440671/#Comment_440671" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T16:19:11+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  4:19PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love elegance in rules and love how so few words can explain the basics of a game like OD+D.

People who can't keep their focus further from five points most probably won't be able to dilucidate what the author actually meant with that short explanation.<br/><br/>A better way could be to expand that explaining through a variety of different media yuxtaposed, like using a comic to explain the basic mechanics and then go back to regular text to go deeper into the subject. You could explain the same thing two or three times trough the text and relating the same subject to different parts of the game on each reiteration so readers understand how everything is connected.<br/><br/>A single short elegant explanation won't do, but perhaps five of those will do perfectly fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Despite all the many books and thousands of words written it seems to boil down to the following:<br/><br/><b>Say what your character does. The GM tells you what happens.</b><br/><br/>11 words! Everything else are just niggly details. Maybe the odd dice roll here and there but that isn't changing the core. <br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/></blockquote>\nI don't find that to be the 'core of D&amp;D', I find that to be most of the core of most RPGs. I think you have to also include a declaratory statement regarding 'Create a character' first. I also think you need to include mention of randomness and permanence somehow. So I'd amend your statement to read:<br/><br/>1. Somehow create a character to portray. <br/>2. Someone describes a setting, scene, or event. <br/>3. Say/show what your character does within it. <br/>4. Utilize a probability tool to determine outcome. <br/>5. Describe how outcome permanently impacts setting/scene/event and your character.<br/>6. Repeat steps 2-6 indefinitely as desired.<br/><br/>So I'd say THAT is the minimalist RPG primer. It still isn't D&amp;D, or any other specific game, but pretty much every game is that. To come up with the basics of any particular game you have to get into the mechanics, not just the theory and themes.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is what it is because it's a mostly fixed-class simulationist fantasy RPG predicated on discrete probability rolls of 6 polyhedral dice and gaussian distribution, with DM-centric storytelling and play. More than that you'd probably have to get into the attributes, class/race options, magic system, alignments, combat elements (hp, ac, saves), and core settings to truly describe the game uniquely. Without all those elements you could be talking about many different RPGs, not just D&amp;D.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440721/#Comment_440721" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-08T00:31:42+00:00" title="December  8, 2014 12:31AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>In the traditional model, the GM and players still jointly control the story for all normal-person definitions of story, because character decisions are such a huge part of (virtually all) stories.</blockquote>\nNo.</blockquote>\nSorry, I forgot, no characters make decisions in any stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440724/#Comment_440724" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-08T07:52:53+00:00" title="December  8, 2014  7:52AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2014 8:04AM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>In the traditional model, the GM and players still jointly control the story for all normal-person definitions of story, because character decisions are such a huge part of (virtually all) stories.</blockquote>\nNo.</blockquote>\nSorry, I forgot, no characters make decisions in any stories. </blockquote>\nIf you block the discussion by saying "This already exist", you will be less benign to listen and understand. Because to take up a defensive position like that is only about fighting for its own world view, instead of taking in other people's views of the world. My "no" was directed towards that behavior, and not towards what you said. (This can be turned around against me, but I'm not the one who's blocking by saying that something already exist. [Funny enough, I said the exact same thing in another roleplaying game discussion on another forum.])<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if it's sequential play, sandbox, or fish tank, because the game master will come up with all the elements and the players can only control these within these frames.

For that I apologize. I don't want dis a classic game. I find it very hard to write a simple rules set that is clear and works. Adding too much more detail into it creates confusion too fast for me to keep up with. Which is why I work on simple stuff. Figuring out the minimum is the best I can do. <br/><br/>The world games use a pretty simple boil down. Something like "A game is a conversation between the players and GM." I like that and understand it. While big books of rules are much harder for me to get that simple idea from. It is the rules writer's dilemma.<br/><br/>BTW ChrisWeeks I toke your condense of my rule and applied it.

It seems like a humorous thought but it's the same thing as you suggested, only seen from the opposite direction.<br/><br/>There are a lot of assumptions in roleplaying game design. Things that aren't questioned. Character sheet, bookkeeping, dice rolling and other forms of extrinsic rewards, what a character perceives and what the players should let the other participants know, how a roleplaying game should be written, building games around conflicts, et c. If anyone suggests to remove this, people can't comprehend how the game could work or even look like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440835/#Comment_440835" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-11T15:45:18+00:00" title="December 11, 2014  3:45PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  If anyone suggests to remove this, people can't comprehend how the game could work or even look like.</blockquote>\nSo very, frustratingly, true so very often.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440837/#Comment_440837" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-11T16:17:36+00:00" title="December 11, 2014  4:17PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."<br/><br/>-- Antoine de Saint-Exupery                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440841/#Comment_440841" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-11T22:20:52+00:00" title="December 11, 2014 10:20PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "But tell people that art in gaming books is mostly superfluous garbage and everyone loses their minds!" - The Joker<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440845/#Comment_440845" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T02:12:52+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  2:12AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joker is an insane, homicidal villain.

Which, quite concisely, is:<br/><br/><b>Describe character. Roll dice. GM decides.</b><br/><br/>Not a bad description of a traditional rpg. Covers a lot of territory, as does your formulation!<br/><br/>However, something about this always bugged me. And I think that, in this thread, Eero nails it on the head.<br/><br/>That line <i>describes</i> what's happening in a game of D&amp;D pretty well. However, it doesn't tell us anything at all about <i>what goes into</i> the game in the first place.<br/><br/>* What's the point? Why do we play at all?<br/>* HOW does the GM make the decisions that she makes?<br/><br/>These two things are fundamental to actually explaining the game. (Although, if all you're doing is creating a description for the *players*, it's arguable that you can leave out the second point. And I think that the RPG industry has suffered tremendously from this unspoken assumption - that game materials are for players, and need not explain the mysteries of what GMs do, because, after all, they already know...)<br/><br/>So, those two points have to be clarified in any complete description of a game, I think.<br/><br/>For instance, this game (below) is quite different from another form of hypothetical D&amp;D:<br/><br/>* Face threats and challenges, seek treasure.<br/>* Your character improves, becoming more powerful, as he collects treasure.<br/>* GM creates a fantastic but consistent and believable world.<br/>* GM decides the most realistic/likely outcome for any given action characters take.<br/>* If your character dies, you lose. (But may start again.)<br/><br/>Compare that to:<br/><br/>* Players describe what kinds of treasures they seek.<br/>* GM describes what dangers they might face if they go after those treasures; players decide which to pursue.<br/>* GM attempts to craft an epic tale of fantasy, terror, and romance.<br/>* Your characters become more powerful in logical sequence with the events of the story.<br/>* Characters only die if it is dramatic and exciting, and you may continue playing with a new character, suited to the current state of the tale.<br/><br/>Etc, etc.<br/><br/>Interesting post! I bet we all have different "capsule" impressions of what D&amp;D is about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440902/#Comment_440902" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-15T11:23:38+00:00" title="December 15, 2014 11:23AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>* What's the point?

And the types of decisions made by the GM can be equally flexible and responsive.</blockquote>\nI'm not saying it can't be done, and Robin D Laws has even built a whole theory around playgroups with players that have different creative agendas. This is something that I can even say is a norm in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that it's an unnecessary threshold to play a game. My favorite example here is the storytelling game <b>Once Upon a Time</b>. It has a competitive part and a collaborative one and both are working against each other. You will end up with two kinds of players: those who compete to win the game and those who collaborate to create a story. Either you end up with a bad competition, because some wont participate, or you end up with a bad story. A good scenario is that you end up with something mediocre at both. A great scenario is when you got only competitive players or collaborative players.<br/><br/>So why have this threshold to allow different kinds of player types? Why didn't they make a game in the first place that attracted only collaborative storytellers that created great stories together? You don't play Chess, to give another example, because you want to express who you are as a person.<br/><br/>Why do we play?<br/><br/>HOW can the game guide us to make that experience the best that is?<br/><br/>If you, as a game designer, says "do whatever you want with it", it's to me like you throw away all responsibility for making a good game. You only leave it in the hands of the participants. And I feel it's a thought that can be found in some game designers. "A good game master can save any game". Yeah, because some game designers leave it up to that person to fix it. Rule 0 comes to mind.<br/><br/>I had great sessions with bad games and I had bad sessions with great games. That shouldn't happen.<br/><br/>One reason of why it happens is because the why part and the how part are vague or contradictorily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440910/#Comment_440910" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-15T14:48:45+00:00" title="December 15, 2014  2:48PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People who are very skilled at chess absolutely, quite often, play chess to express who they are as a person.<br/><br/>And I know people have bad rounds of chess, even very skilled ones.

Thanks, Rickard!<br/><br/>Tod:<br/><br/>Trying to play a game where each player has a different "purpose", and the GM adjusts accordingly to allow them all to play together, is a typical approach advocated by those who (like you, and possibly Robin Laws, I don't know) are strong GMs with lots of experience and skill.<br/><br/>Very much like how a very experienced craftsman or musician can overcome the limitations of his equipment and produce good results consistently.<br/><br/>But it says nothing about the quality of the underlying game, which is what we should be concerned about as designers.<br/><br/>Sure, I believe that you can take a poorly-designed game and five players who have different ideas of what the game is, and then bend over backwards to make it into something fun. I bet you even enjoy doing that: it challenges you and puts the onus of the game's success on your back. If you can pull it off (and I believe that you do), it's incredibly rewarding.<br/><br/>I say this because I've been there myself. It's an enormous challenge and a lot of fun when you can make the game sing regardless. Very rewarding for the GM! However, it does nothing to make the experience better for the players: they are dependent on YOU for that.<br/><br/>Kind of like playing a strategy game with four newbies and one experienced player. The newbies have so little grasp of the strategy that each turn they hem and haw until the experienced player says, "Hey, here's a cool thing you can do! Try <i>this</i>."<br/><br/>As a GM, it's fun and rewarding. You're the center of attention, you're constantly participating in the game, and you can feel your involvement in *everything* that is happening.<br/><br/>As a player or as a designer, though, it's flat and uninspiring. Those four newbies leave the game still without any understanding of how things work, because someone else held their hand through the game and they have no idea why things turned out the way they did. <br/><br/>The contrast between that and a game where everyone is on board with the purpose of play and has full trust in the procedures and tools of play - i.e. understands both how the game works, and what they can do to make it better for everyone else - is gargantuan. Instead of one person holding four other people's hands, we have a group of engaged and confident players trying to take their game to the max.<br/><br/>That's been my experience, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440919/#Comment_440919" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-15T17:47:02+00:00" title="December 15, 2014  5:47PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2014 10:12PM by phoenix182.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>You will end up with two kinds of players: those who compete to win the game and those who collaborate to create a story.

Where I find a lot of wasted effort is in designers operating under the 'right' illusion...that there is a right way to design something, a right game type to play, or a right way to play. This is simply not the case, as your statement illustrates. The illusion also extends to reviews/critiques, and not just design btw.<br/><br/>Instead there is a <i>right player</i> for whatever you design, even if it's you yourself alone. I've long held that if a group doesn't like a game, they shouldn't play it (or feel free to redesign it to fit, though this is less effective than creation from scratch), and if an individual doesn't agree with the group they should find a new group. As always, the burden of contentment/happiness rests SOLELY with the individual perceiving, never those offering or sharing. In very, VERY few cases have I found the problem to be the game/item/idea in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440920/#Comment_440920" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-15T18:11:22+00:00" title="December 15, 2014  6:11PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When I wrote that last post, I thought to myself "I wonder if someone will take this sentence about expressing yourself in Chess, answer it and make the whole post useless because of how I phrased it".<br/><br/>It's sometimes better to read what people mean than read what people write.

If there is such a thing as a "bad game of chess" for (say) a very experienced pro chessplayer, why should we expect even for a split second that there would never be a "bad session of ______________" in a good RPG played by a good player trying hard?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440982/#Comment_440982" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-20T14:06:08+00:00" title="December 20, 2014  2:06PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff.
