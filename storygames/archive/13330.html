What races are most common, which classes are played (or created) the most, what feats and skills are never taken, and so on.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see if they use this for marketing and product development purposes -- e.g., if they know that elves and rangers are popular, they could produce more material supporting elves and rangers, and less material supporting (say) gnomes and paladins.<br/><br/>If you could know how players were using your game rules, what information would you use, and how would you use it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300267/#Comment_300267" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T10:48:39+00:00" title="November 10, 2010 10:48AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2010 11:07AM by johnzo.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: KynnBartlett</cite>If you could know how players were using your game rules, what information would you use, and how would you use it?</blockquote>\nI am not Frederik Jensen, but I'm interested in knowing how often each Montsegur character is selected as a primary character.<br/><br/>I'd suspect that Arsende is usually a primary character, but that the Perfects, being so isolated and alien, are frequently relegated to secondary status.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300274/#Comment_300274" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T11:19:03+00:00" title="November 10, 2010 11:19AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think they already had that data from the various Living campaigns, but I imagine there'll be more of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300275/#Comment_300275" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T11:23:56+00:00" title="November 10, 2010 11:23AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not my own games, but I'd be interested in seeing things like "Where do people get stuck in Parsely games?" or "Which ending is most common in Spooky Manor?"  <br/><br/>Or "What is the percentage breakdown of different white/black outcomes in Fiasco?
