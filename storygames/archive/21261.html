You are imbued with unique abilities, divided into archetypes (known as roots), and summoned to protect the land and its traditions where threatened. <br/><br/>The vibe: robin hood/fairytale land ruled by an oppressive royalty and plagued by monsters. Darkness is robbing the land of its seasons. When called upon by a seer Wardens are bound by oath to resolve an issue, be it protecting a village from the wildhunt, rescuing one of the last unicorns from a Royal hunt, or mediating between the living and the dead. <br/><br/>Wardens are drawn from ordinary folk by the Seer community (the descendants of the old magic, outlawed by the Royals - like the BBC tv series Merlin). Such folk are given a root, a plant that will grow inside them. This transforms them into something alien, a force imbued with the power of the Hearth, the land's ancient heart. The type of root given will determine their 'class': Raven (spirits/mystic), Wolf (ranger), Oak (defence/support), Sparrow (interaction/influence) or Stag (warrior).<br/><br/>My question: i had the notion that each adventure would begin with a ritual. This is the Seer summoning the Wardens from their 'sleep' (whatever it is they do when there are no problems to solve - downtime, essentially) and binding them, by oath, to help. This process, represented with dice rolls or whatever, generates a pool of points. THis is used by the Wardens to purchase starting resources including what i call 'Branches', connections to the mortal world they can draw on to help. The rest becomes Life (hp essentially), but shared communally. Wardens survive until all points are spent at which point all is lost.<br/><br/>So what I would like to know is how alien can I make these beings? Should they remain fundamentally mortal and able to interact while not 'in costume', like Batman or something? Or should they be more like the characters you'd get in a game like Whispering Vault, where you remain fundamentally alien and the adventures are almost always based around the ritual and the resolution?<br/><br/>If that makes sense, thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465779/#Comment_465779" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T14:47:16+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  2:47PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2017 2:47PM by WarriorMonk.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could let that be decided by the amount of starting points rolled or spent by each player.

Maybe younger Wardens are more human, and they tend to become more inhuman over time. At first you're just a superhero with a secret civilian identity, and at the end, after burning away everything from you human life, you're nothing more than a magical spirit.<br/><br/>It could be as simple as determining say three "stages" of development (human, fey and alien) and giving them all some appropriate character crunch (I get the impression that this is one of those games). Then say that all characters start human, but the player can choose to mature them one stage whenever for a one-time power boost (and the changes that come with the next stage, of course). So players can keep hold of the inherent humanity of their characters, or they can throw that away, or they can only give it up under the gravest duress.<br/><br/>Maybe every time you die you mature one "stage", on top of the above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465790/#Comment_465790" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T19:00:56+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  7:00PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" rel="nofollow">Mongrel_GM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Is this world very good vs evil?

But that's not to say it's simplistic.<br/><br/>The game is about tradition and the value of protecting communities, like Robin Hood.<br/><br/>There are forces of darkness in the world that have corrupted it, including evil versions of the Wardens (the wild hunt). Then there's the Royals who are much like King John and the Sheriff of Nottingham.<br/><br/>Inbetween these powers are the communities of ordinary folk who try to live good lives who are protected by the Wardens. <br/><br/>THere's a bit more involved. It's not about spells and magic missiles, the magic of the Wardens is innate. The Seers are more like Druids and keepers of the old ways that people have grown to fear, distrust, or, in the case of the Royals, outlaw. Some keep the flame, and they can be called on to petition the Wardens.<br/><br/>It's not meant to be a complicated setting though. More atmosphere than historic or anthropoligcal study.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465792/#Comment_465792" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T19:07:39+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  7:07PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Interesting premise.

They aren't meant to be incomprehensibly alien though. Finding the balance is key. <br/><br/>I'm not sure this is a game for investigating the humanity of being a servant of the land and protecting people. But then I wouldn't like to say that possibility was completely out of the question. It is a fantasy game about tradition and protection, good vs evil.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465806/#Comment_465806" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-20T19:05:02+00:00" title="August 20, 2017  7:05PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure what sort of system to use.

Some of these I've posted before in a less coherent form elsewhere on the internets. That is: I may have posted them here but I can't remember!<br/><br/>1. Encounters<br/><br/>I'm inspired for this in part by PAX's Thornwatch boardgame. In particular the modular grpahic novel style board elements. These look really cool. Also someone pointed me toward the 'Index Card RPG' which seems to use similar ideas. I happen to think these are cool. I also happen to like using boardgamey elements for rpg design these days (not that I'm any professional nor expert). This is because I like the idea of codifying how games play as much as possible. Similar to what Blades in the Dark does: it sets out how it plays and how things are done in specific terms, rather than just here's the resolution system off you go, and don't forget rule zero (which I've alwasy found a huge copout).<br/><br/>So I posit designing adventures on the basis of a series of encounters using boards/cards to represent things in a very graphic way, as text free as possible. <br/><br/>Each encounter has a Threat value and a Key. The latter determines what actions are required to beat it, the Threat is how many successes or 'damage'. from those actions, from the players, is required. This is deliberately nebulous: the Key could be a boss enemy type, or it could be an actual giant locked door guarded by enemies where defeating them doesn't affect the Threat. Such monsters are considered <i>ancillary</i>.<br/><br/>Monsters don't track hit points. Instead they are either represented by Threat, or they are Ancillary. The latter are defeated on any successful attack, barring unique abilities in their necessarily simple writeups. For example, an Orc would be a basic hit-and-done foe, while a Walking Skeleton might have an ability to, if defeated as an Ancillary foe, gets to come back immediately one time.<br/><br/>The GM will have a resource pool, Darkness, more on this later. One of its uses is to grant any Ancillary foe this ability. <br/><br/>Ancillary monsters are a distraction, they are a challenge, but not THE challenge. They can create interesting conflict for the players. Isn't that the point of enemies anyway? They can make it harder for them to target the Threat value.<br/><br/>Example Encounter Off the Top of My Head: The Goatsblood Shrine.<br/><br/>So the GM lays down an encounter board, a gorgeously illustrated dark and foreboding ancient copse on top of a lonely hill, like something Shub Niggurath would draw.<br/><br/>The GM informs the players this is the Goatsblood Shrine and it is surrounded by dancing cultists, summoning a demon. The Threat represents the spell of summoning and the cultists are merely ancillary foes to stop the players disrupting that ritual. The key: casting spells to disrupt the darkling sorcery at work here. One player, having already acquired the Book of the Goat, must read from it and incant a spell using his Sorcery skill. Doing so deals damage to the Threat. The cultists will want to stop him, and the players must stop them doing that. <br/><br/>This is a timed Threat (so perhaps not a good example): if the players cannot deal enough damage in X turns then the ritual completes successfully. Perhaps another way to do this would be for the GM to add 1 Threat each turn until the THreat builds up to X at which point the ritual triggers, though this seems unfair to the player who will find his efforts just being undone by the GM adding Threat. But it's only an example.<br/><br/>This leads to Advantage:<br/><br/>In the game certain actions can confer Advantage to the players, or leave them Disadvantaged if they screw up or fail to defend etc.<br/><br/>While Advantaged relevant actions do increased outcomes - eg Threat damage.<br/>While Disadvantaged relevant actions are made at 1 less die. That is, they are harder to pull off, but doing so doesn't cheat the player on the outcome he's thusly earned.<br/><br/>More later...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465980/#Comment_465980" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-29T11:03:14+00:00" title="August 29, 2017 11:03AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering if I should take a more World of Darkness approach.

Just focus on how to be the best mystical troubleshooter you can be.<br/><br/>A thought: some rare games treat the player character not as a protagonist of their own story, but rather as a witness or background character of somebody else's story. (Examples: Drifter's Escape, Spione, Dirty Secrets, Acts of Evil, Valravnar for Asagrimmr, arguably D&amp;D 4th edition...) If it were the case for you that you wanted these Wardens to not have personal human drama, something like this could be the thing for you. The Wardens do the fighting and struggling, but they do it for the sake of some NPCs, different ones for each adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465988/#Comment_465988" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-30T01:00:51+00:00" title="August 30, 2017  1:00AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2017 1:01AM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">@ghostwhistler</a> You should probably look at Otherkind (the full game, not just the dice mechanics), if you haven't already.

If you have not, I strongly suggest you do if you can take the production values of the 80's. In this version, Robin is "Herne's Son", the champion of the weak summoned by a forest god. While Robin is a mortal man, he is imbued with the powers of light and darkness.<br/><br/>Of course the series doesn't go really deep into the characters, but the mythic atmosphere built on top of a detailed historical setting is great (for once, we see King Richard that is closer to to the historic version, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466003/#Comment_466003" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-31T07:43:49+00:00" title="August 31, 2017  7:43AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it is influenced by Robin of Sherwood.<br/><br/>But i was trying to create characters a bit more 'otherworldy', like Wshipering Vault. <br/><br/>Just not sure how to make ordinary folk who become sherwood superheroes really interesting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466004/#Comment_466004" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-31T07:49:00+00:00" title="August 31, 2017  7:49AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2017 7:59AM by ghostwhistler.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" rel="nofollow">Cuchulainn</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't know how much this can help you, but maybe it can inspire you a little<br/><br/><a href="http://chaudronchromatique.blogspot.com.es/2017/03/elven-firefighters-campaign.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://chaudronchromatique.blogspot.com.es/2017/03/elven-firefighters-campaign.html</a></p></div></blockquote>\ni considered  having this about playing supernatural creatures (like Grimm types/elves etc), but the original concept was to be something inbetween. So Wardens would not just help the peasants in the village defeat a necromancer hiding in the Royalty, but also help protect the last of the unicorns, and the fairy folk (sort of, it goes a bit deeper). This is sort of Merlin's function in the TV series. <br/><br/>From my notes:<br/>"Elves are in totality a neutral people. They abide by a long standing covenant overseen by the Wardens. This keeps the peace between them and mankind. This covenant includes the opportunity for villages to receive the blessings of the Elves - in return for the customary exchange of children. The mortal family will raise a Elf child to learn the ways of men, and vice versa. <br/>Wardens, particularly Ravens, oversee this as prophecy dictates the necessity of the presence of such beings in the world. Elf reared mortals (and vice versa) are often needed in times of great evil, as they are favoured champions of light and darkness. Wardens do their part by protecting and serving these great heroes. This is the way of the land. "<br/><br/>(elves or fairy folk or changelings, or whatever i end up calling them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466005/#Comment_466005" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-31T14:16:51+00:00" title="August 31, 2017  2:16PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">@ghostwhistler</a> hmm, you should definitely read Otherkind<br/><a href="http://storygames.pbworks.com/f/otherkind.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://storygames.pbworks.com/f/otherkind.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
