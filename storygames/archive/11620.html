Example: D&amp;D; Player's Handbook: E CAN$38,95; F CAN$49,95. I'm unclear whether that's due to the costs of translating, or rather if it's due to transportation (they seem to be mostly translated and printed in Europe, I think). In any case, I would aim to offer translated games at the same price as the original version.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) However, I still want to make enough money to cover costs, and allow for some expansion (translating and publishing more and more games).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking of focusing on games released under some kind of Creative Commons, at least at first, perhaps that would help. However, it might also be a bit limiting. Anyone has some insight to give? ('I'm think Eero in particular might have some ideas).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259152/#Comment_259152" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T22:16:01+00:00" title="February 28, 2010 10:16PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm almost certain that the business model under which those trad games are translated and published has almost nothing in common with what you would be doing, so I don't think that they are very compelling evidence for where your price point would fall. If you want to strive for a similar price point with English-language games, and that is backed by your business model, then why not.<br><br>Which costs would you cover with your profits? Costs of licensing, printing and distribution, obviously, but would you also try to get some money for the translator and book designer, or would this be more of a hobby endeavour from their viewpoint? Considering that most indie designers do not accomplish that last step in their native market to a very appreciable degree, it seems like quite a challenge.<br><br>There is one benefit in a CC licensed game from your viewpoint, and it's the fact that you can publish it in the Internet, which would cut down the hard costs considerably. If you're not interested in that (want to make a real book and get money for it), then a CC-licensed game makes no appreciable difference for you, provided that your publishing plans are at least passably serious. My experience is that it's not too difficult to talk indie designers into allowing you to translate and publish their games, especially if you give them a contract that respects their creative rights. The licensing fees are also probably not as high as you might imagine.<br><br>My own experience in a nutshell: making translations of indie games is easy, and even the tiny Finnish-language market is enough to cover the hard costs with a bit of marketing effort. However, if you want to make significant pay for yourself, then you're in the same situation the designers themselves are - not many of us do make enough money from selling our games, so why would you be an exception? But barring any unrealistic hopes of a salary, there is no particular reason why anybody couldn't translate a bunch of indie games and publish them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

But most of the time Indie Games aren't so expensive so bumping the price a little isn't this bad, especially if your version looks better than the original ! (Which, in some cases, isn't too hard).

I definitely second Jason's suggestion that you contact the original designer/publisher. Most would love to see their work get translated, as it's more money for them; I know quite a few people who got reasonably big breaks in translation through just asking publishers.<br/><br/>However, if you expect to pay translators to do all or some of the work, I imagine the cost will be prohibitively expensive. I'm a professional translator, and I charge somewhere in the region of 17 or 18 US cents per word. This is legal translation, which is a bit harder than roleplaying games, so the price might be a bit less than that for your project. But not much. This also explains why for example you have to pay around twice the price for non-English language versions of D&amp;D, to answer point 1).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259789/#Comment_259789" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T20:35:05+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  8:35PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I do mean doing the translating myself.
