They are<i> pure situation,</i> and present a grim snapshot of France on the cusp of social and technological upheaval.  They look like this:<br/><br/><b>Seamstress Adolphine Julien, 35, threw acid in the face of her runaway lover, Barthuel, a student.  Two passerby were splashed.  <br/><br/>At the cemetery in Essarts-le-Roi, M. Gauthier had buried his three daughters.  He wanted to have them exhumed.  One corpse was missing. </b><br/><br/>There are 1100 of them in the book.  I've <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=F%C3%A9lix_F%C3%A9n%C3%A9on_Orcale" rel="nofollow">started an oracle</a>, perhaps an oracle that only I could love, but you never know.  Anyway, I'm going to marry the book, I love it so much.  It would present some challenges for playing In A Wicked Age, because it's past-tense reporting.  So you'd either have a very melancholy and subtle game, or you'd have a game consisting entirely of flashbacks, or you'd have to roll back the clock on each situation.  Those all sound fun to me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132028/#Comment_132028" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T06:42:55+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  6:42AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...holy... wow...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132181/#Comment_132181" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T16:34:40+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  4:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132196/#Comment_132196" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T18:20:06+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  6:20PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is wicked.  Braiding the oracle output together to create a chapter-setup will be fascinatingly dark.  It figures that the French would have <i>invented</i> 'noir' years before anyone else discovered it.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>I like the idea of taking the entries the oracle gives as literally newspaper reports:  Dry and factual accounts of what happened.  Then, each character's scenes are narrated as flashbacks, often out of order, but tying it all slowly and inexorably together.  It would be like <i>Lost</i>, only darker:  <br/><br/>We see that Barthuel is a student -- a <i>medical</i> student, involved in the theft of a corpse for an anatomy class.  We see M. Gauthier getting dresses made for his charming little girls, sometime much earlier.  We see Barthuel and the seamstress, meeting at a cafe, and becoming attracted to one another.  We see M. Gauthier, inconsolable, contacting the seamstress for funeral clothes after a tragic accident...  We see Barthuel and the seamstress, out drinking with his student friends; obviously a couple at this point.  Everybody knows how this is going to end up, but the tension builds scene-to-scene, anyway.  Eventually, a friend of Barthuel's will let something slip, the seamstress will become suspicious, M. Gauthier will become suspicious...  Graves will be opened, acid will splash...                <br/><br/>I like this so much I'm buying a copy of the book just so I can help you type in all 1100 entries!<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132246/#Comment_132246" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T04:59:13+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  4:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dain, that's great news!
