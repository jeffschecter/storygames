I just picked up his most recent book, <i>The Curtain: An Essay in Seven Parts</i> (2005), which is his take on the history, development, and value of the novel.  Like his previous book of essays, <i>Testaments Betrayed</i> (1992), it has many insights that are relevant to roleplaying. <br/><br/>Like many folks, he begins with a discussion of Rabelais (<i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i>, 1532) and Cervantes (<i>Don Quixote</i>, 1605), who didn't really see themselves as doing anything new when they "invented" the novel, or, really, when they were the most prominent members of a bunch of early novel writers. Kundera then moves on to Henry Fielding's <i>Tom Jones</i> (1749) and Fielding's assertion that what distinguished the novel from other literary forms is its goal of exploring and discovering new things about human nature and life, things that are often far more banal than the concerns of other literary works.  As Kundera says:\n<blockquote>Homer never wondered whether, after their many hand-to-hand struggles, Achilles or Ajax still had all their teeth.  But for Don Quixote and Sancho teeth are a perpetual concern -- hurting teeth, missing teeth. "You must know, Sancho, that no diamond is so precious as a tooth."</blockquote>\nThis discussion then leads into a passage titled <i>The Despotism of "Story"</i>, which is the main point I'm hoping to talk about.<br/><br/>Kundera first describes the basic plot of <i>Tom Jones</i>, in which the main character, much like Voltaire's <i>Candide</i> (1759) ten years later or <i>The Little Prince</i> (1949), spends most of the middle of the book wandering from place to place meeting various characters, some of which join him on his journey.  Then, finally, at the end, the book wraps up with a conclusion to the opening dilemma of the main character.  This style is sometimes called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque_novel" rel="nofollow">picarsque novel</a>.  Fielding also includes a great many digressions in the book, where he moves the focus from the main character to some other point of interest, as in Goldman's <i>The Princess Bride</i> (the book, 1973).  Kundera says:\n<blockquote>When Fielding proclaims his complete freedom with the novel form, he is thinking primarily of his refusal to allow the novel to be reduced to a causal chain of actions, attitudes, gestures, words that the English call "story" and that is seen as constituting the meaning and the essence of the novel; against that absolutist power of story he particularly claims the right to interrupt the narration "as often as I see occasion," with the interpolation of his own comments and thoughts -- with, in a word, digressions.  Nonetheless he too utilizes story as though it is the only possible means to assure unity in composition, to bind the start to the finish.  Thus he closed <i>Tom Jones</i> (though possibly with a secret ironic smile) with the "happy ending" of wedding bells.</blockquote>\nKundera next hails Stern's <i>Tristram Shandy</i> (1759)...\n<blockquote>Whereas Fielding, so as not to suffocate in the long corridor of a causal chain of events, flung wide the windows of digressions and episodes throughout, Stern renounces story completely; his novel is just one big manifold digression, one long festival of episodes whose "unity" -- deliberately fragile, comically fragile -- is stiched together by only a few eccentric characters and their microscopic, laughably pointless actions.</blockquote>\nSounds almost like <i>Paranoia</i> or <i>Toon</i>. I think, too, that many modern novelists have been drawn back to this kind of storytelling-by-assemblage.  I'm thinking, in particular, of David Mitchell's brilliant books -- <i>Ghostwritten</i> (1999), <i>number9dream</i> (2001), <i>Cloud Atlas</i> (2004), and <i>Black Swan Green</i> (2006) -- which contain thematically connected episodes in which certain bits of descriptive imagery serve as reoccurring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif" rel="nofollow">leitmotifs</a>, connecting the disparate elements together. A. S. Byatt also talks about this tendency to look back to early novelists and collections of quazi-related stories (<i>The Thousand Nights and A Night</i>, Hans Christian Anderson, the Brothers Grimm) in her brillant essay collection <i>On Histories and Stories</i> (2000).<br/><br/>Kundera, though, has a somewhat different point.  He says...\n<blockquote>Those who deplored that "insignificance" [of topics explored in early novels] were using the right term... Now, are great dramatic actions really the best clue to understanding human nature?  Are they not, rather, a barrier that hides life as it truly is?  Isn't "insignificance" actually one of our greatest problems? Isn't that our fate? And, if so, is that fate our good fortune or bad?  Our humiliation or, on the contrary, our solace, our escape, our idyll, our refuge?</blockquote>\nThis, again, is the contrast with Homer, with epic stories.  In Kundera's opinion, the novel is founded on the exploration of simple reality of the human condition, on Don Quixote's teeth, which escapes from this "despotism of story," being overly focused on how one event leads to another or the grand actions of superhuman beings.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118523/#Comment_118523" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T11:03:38+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 11:03AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things This Says To Me:\n<ol>\n<li>The value of "immersion" in roleplaying seems like it may be connected, in part, to Quixote's teeth, the desire to explore the fundamental banalities of human existence.  That's an aspect I had never really considered before.</li>\n<li>Many task or conflict resolution systems seem to put an emphasis on what Kundera criticizes as the "despotism of story," moving the narrative forward in a causal manner. I don't think I would cast a value judgement on them, as Kundera does, but it's certainly worth noticing.  However, I also think that some resolution systems, such as in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, mitigate this by allowing players to bring in or invent small details that place the emphasis back on Quixote's teeth.  That's pretty cool.</li>\n<li>I think there has recently been a movement in indie game design towards games in which "story" is not the most important thing being constructed through play.  I see many more episodic games where the various bits of play are not unified into a single narrative but only vaguely connected together.  I think this is a trend in cinema as well, with films like <i>Traffic</i>, <i>Crash</i>, <i>Babel</i>, and <i>Syriana</i> getting a lot of attention for their ability to depict the complex, diverse-yet-interconnected world of human life.  You can even see bits of this in the way they film shows like <i>Heroes</i>, with diverse characters in different locations somehow creating a broader picture of experiences.  Most of the games that consistently produce or support this kind of play have not yet been formally published (they are drafts or Game Chef concepts or in playtest), but Meg's <i>1001 Nights</i> and Joshua's <i>Shock:</i> do this kind of thing fairly regularly. I may be missing some others, due to less familiarity.</li>\n<li>There are still very few (no?) roleplaying games that play like novels in the sense Kundera means, that focus on the "insignificant" aspects of human life as the things that provide meaning, as opposed to an unfolding story of events or grander historical developments.  That's one of the things that excites me so much about Emily's <i>Sign in Stranger</i>, I think, that is has the potential to really support that kind of play, focusing on the most basic and universal human experiences.  From talking to Emily about it, I know that she doesn't want to make that the default play style, that the characters in <i>Stranger</i> can be at the center of major issues that involve the fate of entire worlds if the players want that, but that seems, personally, much less exciting, since I already have a shelf full of games that can do that.</li>\n<li>I really want to write a game inspired by David Mitchell.  Like, if it was a game modeled after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Atlas" rel="nofollow">Cloud Atlas</a>, I'd recruit 5 other designers and we'd each write a completely different game on the same core themes.  Then we'd figure out a way for some of the mechanics or other bits to be shared between the games, so there would be some overlap or interconnectedness.  And then we'd structure play such that play groups would switch between various games between sessions.  So you'd play the games in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  And there would probably be an endgame for each game that only kicked in during the second session of a given game.  So you'd get 6 beginnings and then 6 endings.  And there would be some method of record keeping that would keep track of things developed in the first session to keep everything from being forgotten.  Sounds like a game anthology project for Push 3 or something.</li>\n</ol>What does this mean to you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118532/#Comment_118532" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T11:26:11+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 11:26AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Jonathan. There is a lot here. And thanks for mentioning sis.<br/><br/><i>What does this mean to you?</i><br/>Don Quixote's teeth make me think of John McClane's glass riddled feet. I don't mean to trivialize your examples, but to point to a modern example. Caring about how Bruce Willis' character could possibly make it through sans shoes was something that makes Die Hard a cut above the usual action flick. In this case, it grounded it from fantasy to something that approaches the kind of naturalistic story you are talking about, rather than playing it from the Grand Tale to something about a particular person. <br/><br/><i>I think there has recently been a movement in indie game design towards games in which "story" is not the most important thing being constructed through play.

It's funny, because this is what I have been thinking of as a "literary" quality to narrative that I see us as being better able to incorporate into rpg experiences. Wandering away from the straight arrow story--though that we can arrive at the well-told-tale is a great accomplishment that I do no underestimate and thank--in my design--Ron and the Forge for. <br/><br/>But I want us to take that next step too. To move back out into waters that were sailed by proponents RGFA simulationism. To move through a narrative experience that is richer and deeper than even theme and character development can make it. We've learned to tell stories that matter, now we can bring them to their full potential and step down and back to things like real human experience. Jeep form, for example, choses social realism as its genre to do just that. <br/><br/>Now, question: seeing causality as blocking this kind of exploration may be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Why not have both?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118543/#Comment_118543" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T11:47:26+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 11:47AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I do think Kundera is overstating the degree to which causality is the real culprit.  I think there is some danger in trying to do both at once, when we are so used to pushing hard on causality to form the core of play; people may reach for the familiar instead of the unfamiliar.  But, sure, cutting causality off shouldn't be necessary, especially if people are more used to finding meaning in other aspects of play or have rules that guide them away from a focus purely on causal development. I think <i>Transantiago</i> is kinda like that, yeah?  I mean, there's totally causality in the way situations develop (that's the focus of play, in fact), but it's kinda random and illogical, sometimes, in a magical realist way, which puts more of the focus back on minor character choices, problem solving, imagery, interaction, and emotions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118572/#Comment_118572" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:48:29+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:48PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably been 14 years since I last read any Kundera (<i>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i>). It's largely stuck with me because of two things:<br/><br/>The first is the discussion of the Czech term <i>litost</i> and what generation after generation of being conquered does to the collective psyche of a people.<br/><br/>Ah, here's the quote:\n<blockquote> <i>Litost</i> is an untranslatable Czech word. Its first syllable, which is long and stressed, sounds like the wail of an abandoned dog. As for the meaning of this word, I have looked in vain in other languages for an equivalent, though I find it difficult to imagine how anyone can understand the human soul without it.<br/><br/>    Take an instance from the student\u2019s childhood. His parents made him take violin lessons. He was not very gifted and his teacher would interrupt him to criticize his mistakes in an old, unbearable voice. He felt humiliated, and he wanted to cry. But instead of trying to play in tune and not make mistakes, he would deliberately play wrong notes, the teacher\u2019s voice would become still more unbearable and harsh, and he himself would sink deeper and deeper into his <i>litost</i>.<br/><br/>    What then is <i>litost</i>?<br/><br/> <i>Litost</i> is a state of torment created by the sudden sight of one\u2019s own misery.<br/><br/>    One of the customary remedies for misery is love. Because someone loved absolutely cannot be miserable. All his faults are redeemed by love\u2019s magical gaze, under which even inept swimming, with the head held high above the surface, can become charming.<br/><br/>    Love\u2019s absolute is actually a desire for absolute identity: the woman we love ought to swim as slowly as we do, she ought to have no past of her own to look back on happily. But when the illusion of absolute identity vanishes (the girl looks back happily on her past or swims faster), love becomes a permanent source of the great torment we call <i>litost</i>.<br/><br/>    Anyone with wide experience of the common imperfection of mankind is relatively sheltered from the shocks of <i>litost</i>. For him, the sight of his own misery is ordinary and uninteresting. Litost, therefore, is characteristic of the age of inexperience. It is one of the ornaments of youth.<br/><br/> <i>Litost</i> works like a two-stroke engine. Torment is followed by the desire for revenge. The goal of revenge is to make one\u2019s partner look as miserable as oneself. The man cannot swim, but the slapped woman cries. It makes them feel equal and keeps their love going.<br/><br/>    Since revenge can never equal its true motive, it must put forward false reasons. <i>Litost</i> is, therefore, always accompanied by a pathetic hypocrisy.<br/></blockquote>\nThe second is an insult delivered by one of the female characters (Zdena?) to one of the male characters (Mirek?). Wishing to cut him badly, she said,<i> "You fuck like an intellectual."</i><br/><br/>I remember thinking, "Man, that's really low!"<br/><br/>All that aside, I think Kundera has a point. At the same time, I think his is not a complete answer. I think it is also true that much of what we find pleasurable in novels and stories is that they impose order on the world. In stories, things happen for a reason. People act as they do with cause. Events transpire for a purpose. Story helps make sense of the chaos of life and tells us there is a pattern, even if we can't always see it. Unlike stories, life does not offer this assurance.<br/><br/>To build on Emily's example, it is not enough that John McClane cuts his feet and that it hurts. John McClane cuts his feet as a consequence of a decision that he makes because he is doing what he believes he must in the context of his situation.<br/><br/>It is the combination of cause and effect and the human detail that gives it power that neither the gun fight nor cutting one's feet could achieve on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118581/#Comment_118581" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T13:03:21+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  1:03PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  I think if you want to find analogs in roleplaying, they are there, the ones I see are:<br/>\nHeroism/mundane - To me this maps very closely (as far as from the perspective of creative intent) to Traditional vs Indie. Where the heroic author would embrace so-called traditional game designs. Also, there is the motivation to inspire the reader with a direct example as well as providing well established guidelines of story. While more mundane stories are like indie games where the faith in the reader to find meaning is assumed and that the message is conveyed without trumping it up or falling back on old, possibly worn-out methods<br/>\n<br/>\nPlot progressing vs Plot digressing - This, to me, maps more closely to rules structure. Don Quixote's teeth to me maps more closely to a game designer's pet rule about polearms for instance. Where the author is using the platform of his novel to give a message that they find personally important even if its not 100% relevant to the story at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nCausality - I think the use and nature of causality maps more closely to the shallowness/deepness of a novel - That is stories that are heavily influenced by the theme/idea of causality are usually shallow in nature and promote escapism. You don't have to wonder why the fellowship wants to destroy the one ring, you have seen the effects of it existence and it has proven to be quite bad. Whereas novels that adhere less closely to the laws of causality are more surreal and make you question what the characters are thinking/doing and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to how Immersion in roleplaying maps - I think it is closer to the difference between Tolkein vs Le Guinn than a matter of causality, emphasis on story or any other factor. Where an "Immersive" author needs to elaborate on the setting in order to draw the reader into their world...<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I think that this is a fascinating idea (mapping literary analysis to RPG analysis) and I hope it leads somewhere really interesting (I know it has for me)!<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118594/#Comment_118594" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T13:42:07+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  1:42PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2008 1:45PM by James_Nostack.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I would <i>love</i> to play a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tristram Shandy</span> RPG.  <br/><br/>While Kundera is approaching this from the standpoint of High Art, it's also worth thinking about the commercial side of this as well.  McKee's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Story</span> focuses almost entirely on "plot" - the "despotism of story" which under McKee's regime becomes pretty despotic indeed.  And you can totally see how McKee's way of setting up scenes analogizes almost directly onto games like Sorcerer and Primetime Adventures.  But McKee also talks about "mini-plot" and "anti-plot" works--so, sort of like a movie that toys aroudn with having a plot, but doesn't really and that's not such a bad thing--which I think could be fertile ground.<br/><br/>FWIW, I think there's a lot of "plot" type games left out there unexplored.  I'm still waiting for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Babbitt</span> RPG.<br/><br/>It's funny: when I read fiction, I really dislike all the "plot" stuff.  But when it comes to gaming, "plot" (or rather, the consequences resulting from plot) is all I want.  Is that because in novels genre conventions largely dictate how a novel's going to turn out - whereas with most game designs, the ultimate consequences of plot are indeterminate?

And so are my games. Which is to say that if you ask any players of, for example, my now 5 year old IRC chat game of Heroquest whether the thing seems to have any coherent overall plot or no, they'll tell you that it's nothing but diversion after diversion. <br>\n<br>\nInterestingly, I think it's only Bullfinch's version of Mythology that has any actual plot to it. Rather Chris Lehrich once did some good essays on how mythology in cultures where it's a living thing are very much plotless and storyless. I recall, in fact, that I read somewhere about the difference in styles of narrative, and the example was given of a Native American myth that wandered about, had many lessons imbedded in it, perhaps, but had no overarching plot. <br>\n<br>\nThe tyrany starts with Homer, possibly, but seems to mostly be a modern Western contrivance coming down from that heritage. The story-telling framework in most other cultures doesn't have this feature. It's interesting, in fact, to see how Chineese myths become westernized by the filter of Hong Kong. I've not delved into it deeply, but I'm betting that the original myths were quite a bit less tyrannical about plot. <br>\n<br>\nAnd don't get me wrong, I love a coherent plot. I just like it more for movies and such. Definitely not for RPGs which, since Lehrich's essay, I've decided are a form that fills the drive in us to tell myths. An interesting feature of myth in living cultures is that it's not recorded in singular format, and retold verbatim each time. Indeed Bullfinch only recorded an amalgam of the versions of the stories that he came across that seemed entertaining. Because it's the nature of myth to be told differently each time. <br>\n<br>\nFor us this is simple, because we theoretically make different characters each time. But how often have you actually been playing Gandalf or Aragorn in your game? Or Skywalker or Solo? We're still playing these archetypes, and we're really playing the same characters over and over, and what varies is really the thematic questions we ask and answer about them each time. Whether that be something as simple as the value of teeth, or as deep as questions of epistemology. <br>\n<br>\nThis is something that people mistake about narrativism. That it's only to do with "moral" questions, deep philosophical quandries at the base, ones that can only be explicated through a coherent plot. When, in fact, Don Quixote's teeth played out would be plain and simple narrativism on the decision-making level. <br>\n<br>\nWhich is to say that PTA, My Life With Master, and such games are notable not just for their narrativism, but for an attempt to emulate media that are to do with "tyrannical" plot. And, while I like that sort of play fine, I find that most of my actual play ends up being the rambly "all diversion" sort of material that's not only found in novels like Tristam Shandy, but in every true myth ever told. <br>\n<br/>\nIt's not "Author Stance". It's "Shaman Stance." While we subconsciously are creating meaning, we're mostly "just playing the character" on the surface. "Letting" the character ramble where he will. As opposed to directing his actions in order to create an overarching plot. At least that's what I see when I play, or watch others. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Would this sort of play be serviced "better" by lots of sourcebooks and such? Possibly, but what I find to be key is to not make any of it canon until it hits actual play. This way if you need something other than the canon to support the current diversion, you can have it. The need for "hard" canon is to do specifically with "immersion" and is a different subject than is being discussed here. But I think that the point being made about the library is that, sans hard canon, the knowledge that we all have in our heads that we've gotten from the library is probably good enough to support this style of play. We don't really need the game to supply these details neccessarily. We're all acutely aware of the human condition. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not saying that such info can't be inspirational... I use game canon from a Rolemaster setting in my aforementioned HQ game. We just don't privilege it in any way, and there's probably as much Dune in that game as the setting that is supposedly being played in.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118729/#Comment_118729" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T06:50:31+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  6:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following up on the previous post, the Lehrich article is here: <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=13560.0<br/>\n<br/>\nPay particular attention to the concepts of Syuzhet and Fabula just before he gets into the subject of myth. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118733/#Comment_118733" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T07:12:14+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  7:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>The value of "immersion" in roleplaying seems like it may be connected, in part, to Quixote's teeth, the desire to explore the fundamental banalities of human existence.  That's an aspect I had never really considered before.</blockquote>\nYes, but tangentially and only partly, I think. While focusing on the small things and banalities of the human life is something not overtly explored in roleplaying games, in regards to immersion and the "despotism of story", it's more about the abstraction. By wanting to tell a story, and furthermore, wanting to tell a in a collaborative way, players turn themselves into authors and add an abstract layer between themselves and the character. By investing into telling a story and focusing on moving the story forward, they create something articifial, a chain of events, like a normal novel or movie has. The side-effect is that the the fundamentals, banalities and small things often get skipped, since they move the story forward in much slower pace.<br/><br/>Immersion (at least some form of it) is about exploring the human condition and existence through the characters and only through the characters. Because they are  human. In a way, it's about exploring the human condition through a different lens, the characters. It must contain the flavour of normal human interaction, including the shortcomings of personality and communication, for the player to be able to identify with the situtation. By attempting to tell a story, you might already be separating yourself from the human condition, since there rarely are stories on that level. Life and human interaction are chaotic in nature, unlike stories.<br/><br/>Immersion is about submitting to the human condition and not submitting to the despotism of the story on the player level. There might be a story, but as a player, you don't pay attention to it. You pay attention to the lens through which you are looking and interacting with the imaginary world. Because the lens is focused on individual experience, it often examines the fundamental banalities of human existence.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?

So yeah, <i>litost</i> is such a great concept, something applicable outside of Czechoslovakia too, I think.<br/><br/>James/Luke: it's interesting that the plot of fictional works is secondary for you (James) but the plot of roleplaying games is primary.  I've been reflecting on this to see if its true in my own play, but I'm not sure.  I do think it's interesting that we tend to describe the content of play as "what happens," even in Vincent and Emily's description where "system is how the players determine what happens."  Maybe the focus on "stuff happening" tends to pull our attention towards causal events, physical actions or gestures that lead to reactions?  I mean, Luke's right that causality is everywhere, even in the reflection of thematic leitmotifs that I was talking about, but I think that's a kind of causality has only started to get attention in design.  Keys and Thematic Batteries do something like that, allowing other players to hit your "flags," but it's still very character centric, instead of spreading out a whole bunch of flags that move around or are not directly attached to any specific game entity (some draft of Shreyas' <i>Torchbearer</i> were like this) and letting anyone hit them whenever it seemed appropriate.<br/><br/>JD: Hmm... if I was writing the <i>Tristram Shandy</i> game, I still don't think I would take the giant tome approach.  I think, instead, I would try to encourage players to go off on tangents about subjects that they had extensive knowledge and expertise in.  So, if you were playing with me, you'd get big wandery sections of the game that focused on the philosophy of art or contemporary Chinese religion or lusophone Africa.  I understand that you like waving that old timer stick at us dirty hippies, but I guess I still don't buy it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Maybe if you wanted to have wandery sections of the game that were about very specific subjects that your audience might not know about, but I guess I think it would be too much worth (i.e. not worth the effort it would take) to educate your audience about something enough for them to be invested in play about that subject.<br/><br/>Mike: It's really interesting that you mention mythology and storytelling in other cultures.  You're completely correct that, for example, Chinese epic tales do not have the kind of tyranny of story that Homer does.  Like, <i>The Outlaws of the Marsh</i> doesn't even have consistent characters.  The protagonist constantly changes when the current protagonist meets another person of interest and the story switches to follow this new person.  So you can't really have stories that are all about character development because you don't follow a character long enough for their personality to really change.  Instead, they are all very iconic, easily recognizable, but unchanging.  This is very much like the way I played <i>Rifts</i> growing up.  Characters experience things, but they aren't changed by them so much or character change is not what play is about.  There is no story that is told really.  There is just stuff that happens.  I do find this very much like mythology in many ways, though maybe that's hard to see while playing <i>Rifts</i> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Merten: Great post and that's pretty much the connection I was trying to get at.  You just said it way better and in ways that helped me see other aspects.  I definitely see strong connections between what Kundera wants to get out of a good novel and what many people seem to value in immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118839/#Comment_118839" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T13:04:42+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  1:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You really think Tristram Shandy is fun because people are invested in each bizarre tangent?

It's been 10 years since I've read it, but what sticks in my mind is how self-aware and post-modern it is.  It's in love with everything in the world <i>except</i> its putative plot.  I think Jonathan's idea comes kinda close, but it would have to be done in a screwball, farcically deadpan way.  Most of the digressions, anyway, involve a relatively small group of characters engaged in little vignettes or tableaux.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe digressions would have to be keyed into some kind of reward component, perhaps like the "phrases" stuff from Dying Earth, and you get double points for nesting digressions or something.  Maybe you lose points for reincorporating the digressions (unless invoking a leitmotif), or moving the "plot" along.  And there'd have to be the RPG equivalent of all the goofball typographic tricks, like the Marbled Page and the alphabetical acronym about love, and the chapters that consist almost entirely of blank lines and asterisks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
