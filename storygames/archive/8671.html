But it was pretty dull for me after not very long. I tried to include gaming elements into the horse breeding but they complained I was interfering with the rules, although perhaps more to the point I was interfering with something they were enjoying. So I backed off. But it was dull.<br/><br/>So with 4e, it's very hard to make money. You can make items but the resell values seem to be less than the production costs in some cases. And basically it's how they manage the economy, something that you very definitely need as you move towards MMORPG.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that you shouldn't do it, not in the least, but if characters are going to generate money, then they also need to spend at least as much. In Sim terms, if they can make money adventuring, then full time craftsmen should make more money than the PCs do in their part-time crafting. They should have a serious competitive edge. But then if PCs can, through adventuring, get rare ingredients for more unusual things then that gives them an edge back.<br/><br/>My current group in AD&amp;D have been plundering every creature they've encountered for possible interesting components. So far they've amassed the beak and claws of an owl bear and several parts of a red dragon. One of them even bathed in its blood so I have to decide what that does, I'm going with Siegfried on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191784/#Comment_191784" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T01:11:08+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  1:11AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Jason, tell me more about this thing.

(It's been a while since I've looked at the books.) You could also treat them as a combat encounter in terms of monetary reward: one of the ten treasure packets in the DMG by level (since the DC of the skill challenge increases by your level, you're doing harder work to get more rewards). A steady base of Craft or Profession checks (just house-rule them in as in class skills for everyone) to form the meat of the skill challenge, maybe mix it up a bit with some Diplomacy or Insight checks for haggling, Nature to make it across the wilderness to a place where you can get more gold for your crafts/profession, appropriate knowledges, etc. <br/><br/>Make each check take, I don't know, a week's work on "average" (to make "adventuring" a quicker if much riskier path to riches).

Each year you roll randomly for the harvest, based partly on the previous harvest, and then the players makes choices about what to do with any surplus or how to deal with any shortages. There are also events to deal with such a the visit of a Lord which uses up lots of resources, or bandits or the opportunity to raid one's neighbours. We also had a court in session in each fief to decide on matters of pig ownership or boundary disputes and the punishment for theft. It was all pretty good fun, in fact, it became more fun that the adventuring which can get rather samey with knights.<br/><br/>Do you want something similar to this, but pitched at the level of the barrelmaker? <br/><br/>Here's a take on it.<br/><br/>The basic assumption is that the business varies with the economic climate, and then you deal with crises. So, assume certain levels of business performance, V Bad, Bad, Average, Good, V Good, for example and have a skill roll every so often to maintain the current level of performance. <br/><br/>Failure by 5 or more lowers the level, success by 5 or more raises the level, and each point by which it was made or failed also affects the underlying capital level.<br/><br/>Each performance level also has an effect on the capital level. Average keeps it level, Good is +1 per period, V Good +3, Bad is -1, V Bad -3. Choose a starting capital appropriate to how much impact you want the level to have. So starting at 10 is prone to big changes, 30 less so. You'd have to test it to see what levels are interesting.<br/><br/>Then you can have crisis points such as interruptions to supply, competition, regulation, tax levels etc. These can be decided upon randomly or by player or GM choosing depending on where authority sits in the game. They can affect the underlying level, the difficulty of the skill roll or the capital level.<br/><br/>You can also have opportunities such as taking over other businesses, special commissions that require special materials, ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191821/#Comment_191821" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T07:50:26+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  7:50AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Say your eladrin wizard has tailoring skills. How much mechanical attention do you want to give tailoring?<br/><br/>At the very least, you want some kind of Craft (tailoring) skill. That's an easy mod. What's it do, though? Like you said, in 3E, it told you how you could use it to make money, but you want it to be tied to encounters a little more.<br/><br/>Here's my take on that wish:<br/><br/><b>Craft Skill</b><br/><br/>This skill allows you to make stuff. When you train in the skill, pick a material you work with: cloth/leather, hard metals, soft metals, clay, stone, wood. You may train in this skill multiple times; each time, choose a different material.<br/><br/>You may use your craft skill to make simple, mundane objects of little value. You can sell them, but each object takes a considerable amount of time to make, and you can't expect to actually make any kind of living doing this unless you live in near poverty. Using the craft skill this way doesn't require a skill check.<br/><br/>With a DC 15 skill check, you make one of those simple, mundane objects fairly quickly (like, in a day). No, you can't do this repeatedly and sell them. You simply cannot maintain this pace. If you could, you'd have become a professional tailor instead of a wizard or rogue.<br/><br/>If you want to make items that you can sell for a large profit, you must create special items. These items have all kinds of weird requirements for materials. It's alchemy of a sort. If you want to make a specific item, your DM should make up a list of weird requirements for you and you have to figure out where to find them (perhaps with the help of an Arcana or Nature check). <br/><br/>If you just want to "make something" and sell it, go adventuring. Whenever you kill a strange creature or encounter a weird plant or mineral or hazard, make a DC 20 craft skill check. If you succeed, you can collect some bit of interesting stuff that you can use to make something cool later on. There's no penalty for failure (except waiting). By succeeding five times, you earn the right to trade in one of your magic items for any magic item of the same level. Pretend you distilled your old magic item down to mana juice or whatever it's called (<i>residuum</i>), and used it and the stuff you collected to make the new magic item. The new item has to be the kind of thing you could make with your craft focus. If you focused on cloth and leather crafting, you can't make a suit of metal armor, naturally.<br/><br/>Alternatively, make the magic item conversion into a skill challenge. The final roll must be a crafting check, and if you fail the entire skill challenge, the magic item you distilled down to <i>residuum</i> isn't coming back. You must start a new skill challenge, but you can still use the <i>residuum</i> for the last crafting check.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191849/#Comment_191849" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T09:26:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  9:26AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Craft skill plus skill challenge sounds really cool, especially if you have the help of a player who knows the details of the craft.<br/><br/>Check this out: <br/><br/>DM: Shreyas, WTF do you need to do in order to make these stupid barrels?<br/><br/>Shreyas: Shut up, they're not stupid. I need wood and metal and toolds.<br/><br/>DM: Okay, your first check then is buying those goods. &lt;&lt;roleplaying and stuff&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>S: Oh noes, I failed my roll.<br/><br/>DM: Man, turns out that wood you bought was poor quality. Now what do you need to do?<br/><br/>S: I need to shape the wood. Yay, success!<br/><br/>DM: That wood is well shaped and lovely.<br/><br/>And so on. Fail too many of those and your barrels won't be worth the resources you committed.<br/><br/>It might be cool to work that stuff out in play, leaning on the geeky knowledge of the people at the table. What do you need in order to make barrels? I have no idea, but somebody probably does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
