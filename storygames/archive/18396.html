(Being around a lot of super smart people who really care about systems and how they work has clearly rubbed off on me.) I don't just play games anymore, I try to figure out how they work. I've been playing a lot of computer-based roleplaying games recently, mostly due to lack of people to play tabletop games with, and have been going back and forth between Torchlight and Fallout 3. At one point I turned on Fallout 3, looked at the long list of attributes on the screen while trying to figure out where to put newly-earned points, and I asked two questions out loud to the room (I'm an only child): "How are <i>both</i> of these games roleplaying games when they're nothing alike?" and "How is <i>this</i> the defining feature of what makes a roleplaying game a roleplaying game?" I know a lot of you are gonna think I'm really dumb for not crossing the finish line sooner on this one, but it was at that moment that I really internalized that advancement and roleplaying are different things. And yet, especially in the mainstream, these terms are seen as one in the same thing. <br/><br/>I found <a href="http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/11503/how-necessary-is-mechanical-character-advancement" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> over on the RPG stackexchange that talked about a system someone created for a competition (one of you?) that involved no mechanical advancement and whether or not such a system could sustain fun over the long term. What seems to fall out from that discussion is that the only thing really necessary is change, though I have a feeling like that's a little too simple.<br/><br/>FYI, the question is rhetorical (sort of). Mostly I just want to watch you smart people discuss this so I can learn all of the things.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414623/#Comment_414623" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T12:23:30+00:00" title="May 23, 2013 12:23PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, advancement have never been synonymous with role-playing. I started with three forms of role-playing back when i was 13 years old: Nordic larp, freeform games online, and tabletop role-playing.<br/><br/>For me, the focus on advancement tabletop role-roleplaying games had was a quirk that media somehow become obsessed with. Not something inherent to role-playing. I often became frustrated with this quirk, because the game design was often badly handled, and it didn't give me much in many way. I never found the quest for higher numbers fascinating.<br/><br/>What i want to say with this is while the tabletop tradition of role-playing has a focus on an advancements there are many other forms of role-playing that never had the focus. A great example are the role-playing games that happens on online communities based around for example Harry Potter. While a feature of the Harry Potter genre is that students get older, the role-playing games you find on harry potter forums very rarely have a focus in advancement. Neither so the role-playing games that have roots in the kink or BDSM community. Nor does the cute little "Stable" role-playing communities  online where young girls roleplay that they have house of their own and role-play around stable life and having a horse.<br/><br/><br/>Neither have the Nordic Larp tradition had any focus on mechanical advancement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414624/#Comment_414624" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T12:24:31+00:00" title="May 23, 2013 12:24PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not mandatory: Wushu and Fiasco, fer example.

Age demographics have a massive influence on this: those of us over 30 years old have most likely learned about roleplaying from the tabletop culture (this is just a demographic guess in the basis of what was being played when I or you were 12 years old; obviously does not apply to everybody), and therefore find it pretty strange to equate advancement and roleplaying - that's never been the defining feature in the tabletop rpg culture. However, the younger a gamer, the more likely it is that their childhood happened over an era when "roleplaying" was this computer game genre.<br/><br/>Personally I don't even use the video gaming term "roleplaying game" unless necessary for clarity, it's just so jarring to have the same word used for two entire different practices that share only the most superficial features. I mean, it's not even historically inaccurate to say that what defines a computer roleplaying game and differentiates it from just plain adventure game is character advancement - that's the only feature of Dungeons &amp; Dragons that remains in its CRPG off-shoot, so if it weren't the defining feature, what would be?<br/><br/>Of course, I regularly meet people for whom there is no sharp contrast between a crpg and a roleplaying game; they talk of strange, wondrous and insane things like solo roleplaying and how they immerse in a crpg's story and characters. I'm probably pretty hardcore myself insofar as the crpg genre goes, but this is so far from the emotional relationship I have with this type of game that I can't really even imagine the process in any but the most lurid way. Does explain how anybody could like Final Fantasy games, I suppose.<br/><br/>If we set the crpg genre aside, for which "advancement = roleplaying" is actually the bald truth, then for the tabletop hobby this is a pretty tired cliche. I mean, I'm sure you can turn over some stones and find a bunch of people who'll believe it (really, you'll just need people who haven't played or heard of one of the dozens of roleplaying games with negligible or non-existent character advancement), but that doesn't make it true. We might as well attempt to have a discourse about how having a GM defines a roleplaying game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414629/#Comment_414629" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T12:51:50+00:00" title="May 23, 2013 12:51PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Age demographics have a massive influence on this: those of us over 30 years old have most likely learned about roleplaying from the tabletop culture (this is just a demographic guess in the basis of what was being played when I or you were 12 years old; obviously does not apply to everybody), and therefore find it pretty strange to equate advancement and roleplaying - that's never been the defining feature in the tabletop rpg culture.</blockquote>\nGiven how central advancement has always been to D&amp;D, and that D&amp;D is where a lot of people start with RPG's, that's kind of a strange thing to say, isn't it?

As with most fiction writing, character change happens extremely slowly if at all. Consistent portrayal usually trumps change.<br/><br/>In things like Nordic larp, character differentiation tends to be minimal compared to many other forms of roleplay because the goal is often for players to feel things through their character actions, so the character and player should tie together tightly. Also, these tend to be one-shot events, so again, character advancement would rarely makes sense to begin with.<br/><br/>However, in long term games with a strategic element, character differentiation usually takes place at the strategic level - in the abilities that your character has. So in a game where strategic choices matter, changing the strategic choice context a bit over time by changing your character's abilities is commonly something that interests people. Otherwise, you're working within the same possibility space for a long time, which can get dull and boring and repetitive and repetitive and repetitive...<br/><br/>In long term games with less focus on the strategic, there will be a focus on other things, like relationships between the characters. So tracking change in those areas becomes more important. We can see this with the strings in Monsterhearts or the changing relationship dice in Smallville. By emphasizing change in those areas in the mechanics, the system reinforces the emphasis on relationships as being central to the ongoing story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414635/#Comment_414635" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T14:06:34+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  2:06PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In things like Nordic larp, character differentiation tends to be minimal compared to many other forms of roleplay because the goal is often for players to feel things through their character actions, so the character and player should tie together tightly.

That don't mean that the norm is minimal differentiation between character and player. No more then stage acting means minimal differentiation between character and player.<br/><br/>Even if you need to act out what the character does, you can still play things like thousand year old old elven rangers, or a dying Drag queen in the 80s, or a commander on Battlestart Galactica or some other character concept that  very far removed from who you are as a person.<br/><br/>The same way there an actor can play a character that is very differentiated from them self.<br/><br/>Campaign style Larps is also common among  Nordic Larps, but there is still very little focus on character advancement. If you play a character for 20 years in campaign (I play in such a a campaign. The depth an richness of play is mindnumbling awesome) the character will of course grow and change and learn things during those 20 years of play.  But there is no -focus- on advancement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414638/#Comment_414638" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T14:16:23+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  2:16PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I say Nordic larp, I'm talking about the one-shot art larps with a high emphasis on bleed that are the focus of the academic writing in KP books.<br/><br/>Because every time I try to insist that we need a more specific term (like Nordic art larp) to talk about that specific group of larps every one shoots me down.<br/><br/>And yet here we have confusion again.<br/><br/>Grr. <br/><br/>(Grr not being aimed at you, w176)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414639/#Comment_414639" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T14:24:05+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  2:24PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2013 2:25PM by w176.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I say Nordic larp, I do mean the same thing. <br/><br/>Monitor Celesta, Carolus Rex, Dragonbane, Just a little lovin' are all KP books larp  that where ons shot and used bleed as tool, but did not use thin character and little character differentiation as a tool.

And that you later correctly point out how influenced the advancement-centric culture of crpgs are by the advancement mechanics found in D&amp;D, it's even stranger.<br/></blockquote>\nDoesn't seem that strange to me. I mean, sure, D&amp;D has an advancement thing, and that's the one thing that computer rpgs have truly focused on, but it's no more definitive of the game than e.g. character classes, a GM or using dice. All of these are just individual elements of this particular game - all very dominant elements in rpg history, but none of them ranks as any sort of serious "must have" for rpgs. The GM thing maybe still has some proponents, but as far as I'm concerned practical experimentation has proved them resoundingly wrong. (That is, the existence of GM-less rpgs makes that whole proposition rather below serious notice.)<br/><br/>When D&amp;D was published (I wasn't there, but I've heard told), the thing that captured imaginations and defined an explosion of a new hobby and art form was the narrative, imaginary play space where everything was possible thanks to rules and refereed interaction. This was the thing most different from war games, character advancement was just a wrinkle within the whole in comparison. I would be surprised if anybody during say the first decade of the rpg culture would have named character advancement of all things as the defining feature of a roleplaying game. Having rules to separate from improvised theatre, sure, or having roles to draw a line towards wargames - those were the kinds of things that were discussed seriously as defining a roleplaying game, as far as I know.<br/><br/>Moving on, when I myself came to roleplaying in the early '90s, it was pretty obvious that the point and defining feature of the hobby was still that same one it had been almost 20 years back: it would be something that'd enable infinite possibilities of imagination and artistry in oral, dynamic storytelling play with my friends. This was my point, that people of certain age groups are likely to have learned to relate to roleplaying in these terms, these are the things that would have made us decide on any given day whether we'd play on say the computer, or play football, or play roleplaying games - whether we wanted to play something oral, complex, imaginative.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, of course - maybe a clear majority of 30+ year old roleplayers wouldn't agree with this characterization, but would rather say that roleplaying games are games where you've got a character, and he gains experience points. If this is the case, I just haven't happened to talk with the right people about it. No idea how those people'd explain e.g. Traveller.\n<blockquote>What do you think of the conclusion in the answer on that RPG stackexchange thread?</blockquote>\nA pretty parochial view in my experience (if we're talking of Dan Rasmussen's post in that thread), but I suppose that for a given value of "system" he's probably right - he seems like he has a clear view of his own reasoning.\n<blockquote>And if advancement is not necessary to keep a game engaging and fun over a campaign (which I don't think it is), what sort of change is?</blockquote>\nOK, so we accept that change is necessary for a compelling long-term rpg. I don't quite know what a game that doesn't change over sessions would look like - it'd presumably be like a play, repeated unchanged from showing to showing. That certainly has its own functions, but entertaining the cast of the play is probably not one. (And I'd want to challenge whether it'd be a game anymore, either - can't be a game without dynamic interaction, if you ask me.)<br/><br/>As for what sort of change is minimally necessary from session to session, I'd say that merely a decision to play differently from the last time seems to go some distance, provided that the game has sufficient scope. I don't know if you meant change as a gradual and causal concept (that is, we are changing <i>from</i> something <i>to</i> something else), but if you didn't and just meant having different starting circumstances, then <i>The Mountain Witch</i> and similar scenario-ed games are a pretty fair example of games that are entirely reasonable to play through several times, and the game retains engagement without actually having changed at all. The only thing that changes in this case is the choice of the players on what moves they make in playing the game, and the outcome then becomes different - it's entertaining in the same sense playing Chess for multiple sessions in a row is entertaining. Each session starts with a bunch of vaguely defined ronin climbing up a mountain, but the sessions quickly deviate from each other, and the players are entertained by variations of the theme.<br/><br/>(This is not theoretical, I have been thus entertained. The player base has tended to change somewhat along the way, I admit.)<br/><br/>If we accept the above example as a valid baseline, then we can say that apparently it's somewhat difficult to discern such a small amount of change that it would not suffice as a basis for a roleplaying game that were to be played several times. I find that somebody claiming that you can't be entertained if your attack bonus doesn't go up as a function of time is probably just lacking in imagination and experience of different games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414643/#Comment_414643" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T15:18:03+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  3:18PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An intersting original point. It's probably a relic of the first computer RPGs. I think they took the rules of D+D (movement, combat rolls, hit points, exeperience etc.) and put it in a program - a pretty easy task when you think about it. They translated the GM task of describing the world to showing you the map (with nice color graphics that have only gotten better with time). They dropped the verbal exchanges because they didn't program well and said - Look! A computer RPG! All other games followed the same path.<br/><br/>What I like about story games is how they focus on the narrative part of role playing. D+D did narration but that wasn't easily programmed, so it got dropped. Instead they do the worst of GMing - everything preset and inflexible. People may get into the story - I do with reading - but you can't really break out of it. <br/><br/>So the games you mentioned do have a lot more in common than you might guess. They have graphics to show the world, characters to move around in it, some kind of combat algorithm, probably some puzzles, and advancement. The subjects may be very different but so are games like Call of Cthulhu and Dungeons and Dragons. <br/><br/>I've no clue about the details of Nordic LARP. Only heard a seminar on it last year.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414650/#Comment_414650" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T16:33:49+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  4:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did "advancement" become synonymous with "roleplaying?"<br/><br/>You got me thinking. I like that.<br/><br/>Advancement isn't synonymous with Role-Playing; it is, however, synonymous with Game. It is a reward system that is well known in Computer Game Design theory but the idea predates our hobby and even computers. It feeds a compulsive need many of us have for goal completion/ task resolution. "Just one more level/turn/build phase, then I'll go to bed. Okay, maybe just one more..."<br/><br/>  One of the more recent iterations of this theory is Badges. Collect 50 Golden McGuffins to gain 50 xp and the Golden McGuffin Collector Badge! Fallout 3 has this in the form of hidden Perks (kill enough giant ants and you'll get one).<br/><br/>  It creates a (false) sense of achievement. I've felt it myself. After completing a particularly difficult game/level/map I look around, half expecting some material award or at least a parade. <br/><br/>  Browser games are particularly bad for this; they actually are DESIGNED to be addictive. Ask any "Garden of Time" fanatic (I know a couple. I still don't get the appeal).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission" title="EndTransmission"><img alt="EndTransmission" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/428/nBVTR0D284U65.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission">EndTransmission</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414651/#Comment_414651" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T17:35:46+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  5:35PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think in a certain subset of the mainstream media, Advancement *is* synonymous with Role Playing, not just with Role Playing *Games*.

Sorta like <a href="https://plus.google.com/118131565520525592332/posts/AQ8V92QpjJ1" rel="nofollow">what Vincent Baker said about nano-games vs. game poems</a>, how those were two marketing terms. The main point is, when it comes to dividing things out, the label doesn't matter so much.<br/><br/>Though it can be interesting to observe and catalogue <i>why</i> some things are classified as such. I think the big reason when it comes to CRPGs is "character-based customization". You have a character, and you can modify things about that character. Leveling up and other advancement just come part and parcel with that, especially as a means of keeping things fresh and letting you start humbly (and accessibly) and end powerfully (fighting the big bads, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414658/#Comment_414658" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T19:49:21+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  7:49PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>When D&amp;D was published (I wasn't there, but I've heard told), the thing that captured imaginations and defined an explosion of a new hobby and art form was the narrative, imaginary play space where everything was possible thanks to rules and refereed interaction.

I would not have named character advancement THE defining feature, but to me in those days it WAS a feature without which a game didn't feel right to me. You're right, the defining feature was the opened ended narative play (which I never really had a clear definition for until I head the Lumpley Principle expressed). So not THE defining feature, but important nonetheless. It was the combination of open ended imaginative play combined with campaign play for which advancement was critical to. Traveller, being one of the first games essentially without advancement (other than wealth, and the little understood rules for small improvement) didn't feel right to me.<br/><br/>And honestly, I still struggle to feel like a game that did not offer some form of mechanical change of character, most easily described as advancement (even if it was something other than numbers getting better) would be of interest to me.<br/><br/>So back to the initial question, is advancement synonymous with roleplaying? No, but I'm not sure if that's exactly the question being asked though.<br/><br/>Frank<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_414668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414668/#Comment_414668" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T00:57:42+00:00" title="May 24, 2013 12:57AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Advancement of mechanical traits is traditional, nothing more.<br/>Role-playing is all about stepping into the shoes of a different role. <br/>*<br/>You do not have to have mechanics to play a role.

I myself don't find it amusing with character advancement any more, but it can be one part that makes the player more and more <b>invested </b>in the character. There are of course other ways of create an investment, and XP is thrown around nowadays as a reward without much thinking about other things that can work as rewards (hello FATE and Burning Wheels).<br/><br/>To me character advancement has been reduced to something clich\xe9. Something that is thrown in just because it should be there and it seems like game designers can't think any longer than giving XP (or plot points, feats ... or powers) as reward for participating. It would be nice to talk about other ways of advancement, just like in the link that you gave in your first post (Story and Setting Advancement). It's along the right way but not far enough IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414684/#Comment_414684" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T08:39:46+00:00" title="May 24, 2013  8:39AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To me character advancement has been reduced to something clich\xe9.</blockquote>\nThis is kinda what I meant by lowest-hanging.

As the name implies, it drew from D&amp;D, including the idea of character advancement (though for <a href="http://www.rpgfanatic.net/advanced_game_wiki_database.html?p=news&amp;nrid=5049&amp;game=dnd" rel="nofollow">slightly different reasons</a>). So damage rolls and so forth weren't normal things in video games before D&amp;D started influencing them, mostly because the D&amp;D influence was really early. (Wargaming was another influence, so in that sense D&amp;D's advancement probably was novel.)<br/><br/>The definition of the CRPG has always been a bit fuzzy and to my mind doesn't have all that much to do with the definition of roleplaying except as a historical accident.

For those of you who aren't wargamers, you might not get why those things go together.

For them to be meaningful, they have to be tough, which means right here and now you can't really do shit about them, but if you work at it, then later you can.<br/><br/>Then again I could just be talking out my ass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414714/#Comment_414714" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T15:39:18+00:00" title="May 24, 2013  3:39PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I designed a roleplaying game that did not have in-built goals, and prevented players from forming them by resetting the game state every couple of scenes unexpectedly.

I don't know how much intentionality there was over the three-way meaning of "level" in D&amp;D (character level, dungeon level, spell level) but I think it's really important. A few sandboxes and sims aside, pretty much all non-rpg computer games feature the Dungeon Level, constantly changing the site of play. This kind of game (so platformers, pac-man maze games, and fighting games at the simplest, but puzzle games and shooters too) doesn't have character advancement but is built around another mastery and player advancement. Discovering the next Level, and realizing that you totally can't handle it yet, is a pretty neat feeling.<br/><br/>I think a lot about fighting games especially because of the way they build a society around this advancement and construct a kind of athleticism.<br/><br/>So yeah, the purpose of the Level of either kind is to make changes in the scope of play possible, to present goals that a beginning player can't do, to reward continued play, repetition, and mastery. Some of the addictiveness of character-advancement games comes from layering the Levels on top of themselves\u2014grinding to catch your character advancement up with your player advancement is a technique that draws out anticipation for the goal-success, and produces a complex system part of which takes place outside of the game's code.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue" title="Greentongue"><img alt="Greentongue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue">Greentongue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414895/#Comment_414895" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T05:07:54+00:00" title="May 29, 2013  5:07AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2013 5:10AM by Greentongue.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>How did "advancement" become synonymous with "roleplaying?"</i><br/>In my opinion it was when people wanted a way to indicate they were <b>better</b> at playing. <br/>"Clearly I'm a better player because my character is level XX and you are only level V."<br/>=                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414947/#Comment_414947" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T20:15:14+00:00" title="May 29, 2013  8:15PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what happens when you have something like the riddle of steel, where if you follow your characters goal, you get a spiritual attribute die to add to/advance your other dice (and you can spend, at a slower rate, advance your skills)?<br/><br/>Perhaps advancement became synonymous with roleplaying, because rather than being 'this other thing' its actually as close as traditional mechanical design could get to marrying mechanics and characterisation into one thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
