A games design contest progresses as normal, then...<br/><br/>After the game rankings are in from the judges, a playtest period of 3 months follows.<br/>The winner's game gets played by the runners up, the runners up games get played by the third tier games and they get played by the plebeian games. No one has to playtest the plebs games (a noble winner should do one). Then the second phase of the competition on who does the best AP playtest write up. Then announce grand winners and final rankings.<br/><br/>The comp could even have a rolling playtest award thing - the best AP playtest every 3 months wins a playtest next quarter. And can rise up the rankings. How cool would that be!<br/><br/>Joe thinks that the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4549&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">M@ke game$ fast</a> contest will be too small to accommodate such an ambitious concept. I suspect he may be right (and a book on spam is alluring enough). Spam leading to a pyramid scheme would be quite fitting though!  <br/><br/>It might work for Reversed Engineer and would give a third level of ownership to each game. <br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103000/#Comment_103000" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T12:35:23+00:00" title="October 14, 2007 12:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My only first reaction is that playtesting is much harder to organise than writing the game, you might get a lot of defaulters                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103010/#Comment_103010" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T13:36:04+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  1:36PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I saw "Pyramid Playtest" I assumed you meant <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/playtest.html" rel="nofollow">these thingees</a>.<br/><br/>Something like this might work, but I think you'd need stricter and more manageable guidelines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103012/#Comment_103012" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T14:20:11+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  2:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2007 2:20PM by Joe Murphy.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'A third level of ownership'.<br/><br/>Sounds like a fantasy football league.
