Basically, send me any amount of money*, and you'd receive the game in an electronic form. Over a certain donation, basically printing+shipping+$1, I will also mail you a physical copy of the game. I'm also considering having a recommended donation, which is what I'd normally charge for the book.<br/><br/>For example, let's assume that $8 is the cut-off for a print version and $20 is the recommended donation.<br/><br/>Would this make you more interested in buying the game?

And I'm not really used to the situation, so I'm coming to terms with not just buying any(small)thing I want.  In this situation, if it were a game that I already wanted, but not a game that I *must* have, then it would make me more likely to buy it.  <br/><br/>And I might treat it as a try-before-you-buy thing, giving you the smallest amount I can, trying the game and then paying you a fair amount later if it were as good as say, Polaris.  Or some amount less, depending.<br/><br/>How much I think I'd pay is a fabulously complex issue.  It depends on (among other things): how much I like reading it, how much I play it, how much I think you're selling, how finished the product seems, what kind of support for the game you provide, how much of a jerk you are, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301024/#Comment_301024" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T14:30:05+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  2:30PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd likely be less interested, but that's largely because I have this retail sideline that colors my viewpoint and somewhat controls which games I'll buy - these fancy payment models tend to fuck up retail, and especially the sort of long-term boutique sales model we have. I'd be disinclined to invest in a half dozen copies of the game as a retail investment, say, as it would be more difficult to price them fairly and sell them when the publisher has a fancy direct sales plan. As strange as it is, the fact that I'd be disinclined to buy a half dozen might cause me to not buy a personal copy, either, as I tend to get enough games for my personal needs out of the retail thing.<br/><br/>Setting that aside, considering the game as something to buy personally... I'd say that the model would have no positive nor negative aspects for me, really. Price points concern me little when I make my buying decisions (not rich, but I buy anything so rarely for myself that price does not become a concern when I do), and the extra flexibility I'd get in choosing my payment would be offset by the uncertainty I'd get from buying something where the seller does not show confidence in their product by pricing it themselves. So it'd be more or less even. As for price-point, I would either do your recommended donation or the minimum donation, depending largely on your wording for the deal; if I felt obligated or virtuous for doing the recommended number, I'd go for that without a second thought, but if I felt annoyed by the pressure or indifferent towards you or your product, then I'd do the minimum (or just pirate the game, actually).<br/><br/>I'll also add that a variable payment model is interesting not because of demographical tendencies that favour it, but because of the extra profit it stirs out of multiple marginal demographics: you can get small amounts of money out of the large number of people who are only minimally interested in your product, and you can get extra out of the solid hardcore audience, thus optimizing your profit for several audiences. It seems to me that this is best achieved by encouraging the customers to self-categorize themselves efficiently: allow the big spender to buy an extra-expensive package, allow the marginally curious to buy the extra-cheap package and so on.<br/><br/>Considering the above, you might want to set up a third, premium level of payment, exactly because you want to enable people to categorize themselves: if I were excited about your game and it was clearly limited out of retail circulation to not confuse me, I well might spring for a premium option such as a hardcover color version of the game or some such, making extra profit for you. Word it right and I well might have more motivation for this than I'd have for the options you list; it's a fact that the difference between spending $1 and $50 is less of a hurdle for me than the basic issue of whether I'm interested in buying something in the first place, what with the credit card hassles and getting the package out of the post office and all that noise. Make it more exciting and worthwhile for me by offering more value, and I'll be perversely more likely to make the spend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301028/#Comment_301028" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T14:37:40+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  2:37PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2010 2:39PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>For example, let's assume that $8 is the cut-off for a print version and $20 is the recommended donation.<br/><br/>Would this make you more interested in buying the game? Less interested?</blockquote>\nMore interested, assuming that the game is something that already strongly appeals to me, in genre, in mechanics, or whatever.  There's literally no price low enough to get me interested in a game that I don't already want, but I expect that's true for most people.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Let's say that you were interested in buying the game. How much do you think you'd pay? Why?</blockquote>\nBased on the pricing examples above, if I was convinced to buy I'd probably go for $10 on the printed version.  That's an easy round number in my "money I don't have to think about before spending" level.  It's also a price that I tend to associate with being a really good deal: not just a good bargain, but also inherently more likable (because a book that would be awful at $50 and disappointing at $25 becomes pretty good at $10).  I'm not saying I wouldn't pay $20 for the right book, but it would actually be a <i>decision</i> to do it...I'd have to think about what else I could be using that money for instead, whether I'm likely to actually play the game in the next few months, etc., because my natural tendency is to ask "Do I really need this?" before buying anything that costs more than a nice lunch.  Below that pricepoint, I'm less likely to ask questions and more willing to get off the fence.<br/><br/>I'm not likely to spend anything at all on the electronic version unless there's something that appeals to me on a different level.  For example, if the PDF was extraordinarily good (formatted to be read easily on a laptop screen, searchable, good bookmarks, etc.) and I really liked the game, I might want to throw some money in to try and encourage that level of quality in other PDFs.  If you were in the midst of a serious financial crisis, I might throw some money in as basically a donation to keep you from being evicted or starving or going without chemotherapy or whatever.  My gut-level instinctive purchase point would probably start at $5 and under no circumstances go higher than $10, because paying more than that for even an extraordinarily good PDF is just plain crazy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301034/#Comment_301034" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T15:07:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  3:07PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Points of reference:<br/><br/>1.) I used to sell Ribbon Drive for $30. Now I sell it as "pay cost + whatever you want." The most common payment is for $30. There are some who pay $20, and many who pay $24-26. In general, I've felt like people have responded to my offer with sincere generosity.<br/><br/>2.) I've been spending a lot of energy this week helping my coop radio station run their membership drive. A membership at the station is on a wide sliding scale - you can pay anywhere from $25-80 for a yearly membership. People tend towards memberships at the higher end of that scale - $50-60, at least.<br/><br/>I think that sliding-scale pricing tends to work well. Lots of people will tend towards the higher end of the scale. Others will be delighted to get the thing at a rate that they can afford. I've never felt snubbed by this system, personally.<br/><br/>Then again, I live in a hippy community where sliding-scale prices are actually fairly normal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301038/#Comment_301038" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T15:39:03+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  3:39PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, could I get the game (perhaps for the minimal fee), then decide what to give you?

The best example of this I've seen recently was Mr. Newman's categories for his Human Contact Kickstarter buy-in. He had a fairly diverse set of buy-in levels with an equally diverse value proposition for each level. I think it really allowed for people to not only be supportive of the project but to find a level of buy-in that felt like a good value to them as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301045/#Comment_301045" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T16:32:59+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  4:32PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Ben, could I get the game (perhaps for the minimal fee), then decide what to give you?

That is, just give me the game in exchange for my email address, and promise to write me about it in a week or so. Then when you write (an automated form letter is OK, the point is just to remind me about my "purchase"), you can ask me what I liked about the game, and then I can give you some feedback and tell you how much I'm going to pay you - nothing if I didn't like it, your suggested price if I found it worthwhile, or the extra deluxe package price if I really got excited by the game. (Or any other payment of course, but it's a good idea to give me some guidelines just to make it less of a bother for me to try to figure out what you're expecting.)<br/><br/>For some reason the above procedure seems more likely to make me actually initiate the process instead of just not doing it. This is probably because I don't need to make the actually rather difficult judgment of how much to pay you at the beginning of the process; once I have to make the choice I've already checked out the product and formed an opinion on whether you're a poor fool, a talented author or my new favourite rock star designer.<br/><br/>Yes, this might well be my strategy if I wanted to go with variable pricing. I especially like the idea that anybody who wants the game is sort of forced into a correspondence with me, ensuring that I at least get a lot of apologizing letters about how the game didn't really fly with my audience. Besides, a solid customer database is a beautiful thing that comes out of this arrangement without any extra fuzz.<br/><br/>(Admittedly giving out my email address is a bit of a threshold, so if I wanted to have no threshold at all, I might even try to somehow get rid of that limitation. Still, I'm confident that good production values and an interesting spiel will convince the likely customer to take that much of a leap - if not, then they wouldn't be paying you for the game, either.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301157/#Comment_301157" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T12:48:36+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 12:48PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the sliding-scale option.

I've never seen it done before with an RPG, but I've seen indie video game designers sell their games this way, usually as a promotion, but sometimes as a more long term thing.  Sometimes it makes me more likely to buy, but even if I don't buy, it definitely makes me more likely to <i>tell all my friends about it</i>.<br/><br/>I don't know how similar selling indie rpgs and selling indie video games over the internet are, but Paul Eres has been selling <a href="http://studioeres.com/immortal/buy?home" rel="nofollow">Immortal Defense</a> under this model for awhile.  He seems pretty open about talking about the business/money side of things on his blog. (I also remember before he made the game permanently "pay what you want" it was available that way as a promotion over the holidays like a year ago, I think.  He posted a bit about what people were actually paying and how it worked out with PayPal's cut.  The funniest, though possibly cruelest, person paid him exactly enough that he'd net $0.01 after PayPal's fee.  Now there's a minimum payment of like $1.75 or something)  Also, if you play video games, that one is amazing.

Once $X have been donated, one of my supplements would be moved into the public domain and would be freely available.  It would function as a bit of an open-ended auction and if I never reach the total, it is fine on my end.  This option would allow people to pay the minimum amount on the base game and donate anything else to the cause.

To make the local, independent brick-n-mortar model work, I need a  cost of goods in the 55-60% range and that makes it tough to justify carrying anything I make much less than 45% margin on.<br/><br/>If the suggested donation is ten bucks, that's the SRP as far as retailers are concerned.

In practice you wouldn't see many people doing this, of course; part of the psychology of buying is that you own the thing fair and square after the purchase, after all.<br/><br/>In theory nothing prevents using the shopkeeper as a middleman, of course, if he wants the hassle of discretionary pricing for himself as well. Fraud is a danger, obviously, but aside from that there's no reason why you couldn't just split the incoming money 50/50 or whatever with the shopkeeper. I for one would be loathe to mess with this sort of thing as a retailer unless it became common practice or the game was very special due to the work of setting up a discretionary payment product in the systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301376/#Comment_301376" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T02:22:49+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  2:22AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2010 2:24AM by Mcdaldno.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Hmm, combining retail with pay-what-you-want is certainly an interesting issue - I wonder if it's possible?</blockquote>\nI do this currently, sort of.

I list the cost to produce it, and the averaged cost of shipping, and then ask people to pay [cost + what they want]. The cost &amp; shipping portion is $17. The lowest total payment I've received is $18 (once). I've received an equal amount of $20, $26 and $30 payments.<br/><br/>I'm selling more through this model than when I had a fixed price tag. I'm making more total money, though make a bit less money on the average sale. It feels much nicer to sell via this model than to sell at a fixed price. Each sale feels more like a dialogue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301941/#Comment_301941" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T12:25:14+00:00" title="November 23, 2010 12:25PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm most curious about information that probably isn't really available: namely, what causes someone to pay a given amount when they can choose to pay anything.<br/><br/>for my part, in this particular example, i'm tempted to buy Polaris for some super cheap amount, the reason being that I'd consider a PDF "nice" to have, but have previous bought a hard copy and thus don't feel "obligated" to pay more, as I likely would if I had never bought the game before.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I've ever had to decide what to pay for something with even less determining factors than this: when I've taken part in Kickstarter campaigns, for example, I was guided by the various reward levels.  When I bought Immortal Defense during the holiday "pay whatever you want" deal, I paid the amount at which the creator also counted it as a pre-order for his next game.<br/><br/>There are, of course, numbers lodged in my head for no real good reason that I consider "good prices" for things.  I suspect, for example, that if I was considering buying Polaris or Bliss Stage for the first time, and they had fixed prices, that I'd consider $10 bucks or less for a PDF a "good deal," $15 "pretty reasonable" and I'd start raising my eyebrows at the $20 mark.  And I'm not really sure where these numbers came from, except from other PDFs I've seen and purchased.  I certainly don't know if that's what they are "really" "worth" . . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301953/#Comment_301953" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T13:29:18+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  1:29PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Want some hard data? I got <a href="http://2dboy.com/2009/10/19/birthday-sale-results/" rel="nofollow">some great, hard data about a long-tail PWYW effort</a>. It's even an independent publisher (albeit of a wildly successful indie video game).<br/><br/>If you folks are unsure about rolling out with PWYW pricing, then perhaps some of the "old guard" who have slow long-tail sales could try it for a "bump." I'd CERTAINLY consider doing PWYW pricing before I'd totally stop selling at all, dropping to a budget price, or toss it away for free. I'd bet that more-famous designers or products could really benefit from a second "round" of PWYW pricing. Perhaps make it only for a short time, to foster urgency, or only for a limited number (to run out a print run, or for additional urgency).<br/><br/>I'd also like to note in the conversation that I think the "app mentality" is making such sales more successful. The value proposition has shifted: where once someone would see a $5 'thingie' as cheap or incomplete or a gimmick/toy, now that's a solid price point for an experience that is limited... and EXPECTED to be so. RPGs--especially hyper-focused and tightly-paced RPGs like y'all make--parallel that limited experience. Put another way: someone will drop $5 or $10 on a game in which they're interested--and might never even play--BUT you're not getting the $60+ price point out of them unless it's something with a LOT of clear reusability, popularity (i.e. can I find players easily; do *I* want to play it a lot?), and "heft" (D&amp;D, HERO System, Descent/WHFRP3). Kind of like how the same folks who drop $50 + $15/month to play an MMORPG will drop $5 to play Angry Birds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301966/#Comment_301966" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T14:12:45+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  2:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry Joe, your earlier post totally slipped my mind.<br/><br/>I do wonder if/how this effects any sense of devaluing some people seem to have when faced with a price set below their expectations.

But strictly speaking, Donationware gives itself away for free with an option to buy the same thing with a donation (typically very small--$1). If you make someone pay even a penny, you're forcing two points of sale to get your second "up-sell" donation. PWYW strategists, in the strictest sense, should build pitches and promotion of the PWYW pricing under the assumption of a single point of sale.<br/><br/>And neither of them are the "limited version free but pay for full version" model as is employed with How To Host A Dungeon and--someday--my own GLASS.

I think I'm still operating within the realm of capitalism, I'm just drawing on more modern concepts of economics such as hedonistics. Capitalism where preference and emotional engagement (on both sides) are considered, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Thus far, I've gotten improvement on three metrics (money, emotional engagement, and number of copies distributed.) There's no "underpaying" going on because Bliss Stage and Polaris, as art objects and luxury goods, have no fundamental value. I have just moved the arbitrary valuation from me to the customer. In the last three days, I consider that basically a win all around.

I guess you find your income elsewhere. The fact is that you have no strong economic incentive to sell your games. Am I right?<br/><br/>That is ok. And not. Ok that you have an income to live on. Not ok that your "luxurious situation" contribute to punch out the bottom of the rpg-market, as setting prices on your games is a luxury you delve into, a game you enjoy messing around with.

Bah!</blockquote>\nSo your alternative to the pay-what-you-want model is to enforce through pricing a false situation of scarcity that will supposedly make your game more likely to be played? What if your game is crap? Once the word gets out how many people are going to pay $50 for it let alone play it?<br/><br/>Let's say your game isn't crap. Now only people that are willing and able to pay $50 are able to purchase the game and possibly play it (plus their friends of course). I propose that this will lead to far less overall play of your game than a pay-what-you-want model. Paying a lot of money for something is no guarantee of use (or of the product being fit for use). You will almost definitely have fewer people buying and exposed to your game at a $50 price point which is basically a guarantee of less actual play.<br/><br/>There is no way at all to guarantee play of your game. All you can do is make the best game that you can and then get it into the hands of as many people as possible. Wide exposure is going to lead to more overall play (and eventually more profit if your "cultural capital" thing works out) than putting your game behind $50 worth of glass.<br/><br/>It's simply a manner of trying to align what is best for you with what is best for the customer, IMO. Nobody has any obligation in regards to "the rpg market". Unless you're into price-fixing. Basically Tomas, your arguments sort of sound like moon language to me that is built around all the economic skullduggery that permeates the modern marketplace. Maybe that makes me a Socialist Hitler?

The psychological and social issues are so complex and individual in this regard that I think that the "one size fits all" pricing tradition has become a burden in many ways.

As a result I very carefully consider the games I obtain, considering price as well. I have the ability to access games that are cheap or free much better, and kick the designers what I can give me a sends of doing something as opposed to nothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider this many people torrent things to check them out and decide if the cost is worth the purchase.

Spending all my discretionary income in one go on a game book was serious fucking business.<br/><br/>When I was a highly-paid software engineer.  I generally had a lot of money left at the end of the month.  Spending $20 on a game was trivial.  Spending $50 on a game was something I could do on an impulse.  <br/><br/>So if we're talking about exchanging value for value, an indie designer who charged graduate-school me $10 for a book should charge software-engineer me closer to $100 for that book, because software-engineer me has more discretionary dollars than graduate-school me and thus values them less.<br/><br/>I also think the value of games is not only in the playing.  Fudge, for instance, changed the way I thought about games before I ever played it, and would have had that same effect even if I had never played it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302244/#Comment_302244" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-25T06:50:05+00:00" title="November 25, 2010  6:50AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a good business strategy in this model would involve giving people an idea of how to gauge the overall economic utility they derive from the product.

If I give you my game for free, and you review it on a prominent website, maybe that nets me more paying customers in the long run.  <br/><br/>Maybe I only give it to you for free in exchange for this review; or maybe I give it to you free first and then politely request a review or write-up.  I have no idea which would produce the optimal combo of immediate sales, goodwill, name recognition, and long-term sales.<br/><br/>These are just my own thoughts, but they're inspired by what happened when I requested Polaris and Bliss Stage from Ben for $0.  He said, "Sure," and then noted that he'd appreciate write-ups on ENworld or RPGnet.  And I thought, "Hey, that's a perfect way for me to chip in!  I already have some Forge AP musings on Polaris from last year.  I'll just edit, reorganize, and post."
