We're honoured that people think so highly of our little get-together, and I think it's a good model for other small cons. However, there are other, far better cons out there that are more deserving of the award.<br/><br/>We also have a shiny new <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/111173227620970453747" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow Community on Google+</a>. Please pop in and have a look!<br/><br/>And without getting ahead of ourselves, we're still after games for Concrete Cow 13. Epistolary Richard has offered three games, but I'm sure everyone else is just champing at the bit to tell the world about the games you'd like to run. Don't be shy! Let us know and we'll do our best to tell the world.<br/><br/>Here's what Richard's offering:<br/><br/><b>Forsooth! LIVE!</b><br/><br/>Forsooth! is a Shakespeare-themed story game in which we create a new play in the style of the great bard. Lovers, duels, fable, witchcraft and all of human emotion are at your disposal. If you love theatre, or literature, or being a complete ham for the amusement of yourself and others, this game is for you.<br/><br/>In Forsooth! LIVE! we'll be taking the game one step further and putting it on its feet! We'll keep the game at the core, but with a bit of larp, a bit of improv and few props, we'll breathe life into the pivotal moments by acting them out. So ideal players should be willing to throw themselves, literally, into their characters.<br/><br/>Author: Sam Liberty &amp; Kevin Spak<br/>unGM: Epistolary Richard<br/>Players: 3-8<br/>Slot: Afternoon<br/><br/><b>Intro to Indie / Story Game Demos</b><br/><br/>Sample a whole range of classic and cutting edge story games in a single session. There'll be 30 min demos of a variety of indie press GM-less games, some classics, some hot off the press. Players can step in or out of each demo as they desire. Specific games being demoed will be announced closer to the date to ensure there are some of the latest releases. If you're curious about story games or GM-less gaming and want to have a taste of what it's like, then this is a great place to start.<br/><br/>unGM: Epistolary Richard<br/>Players: Up to 6 players for any one demo<br/>Slot: Morning<br/><br/><b>Mobsterhearts (Mafia Hack of Monsterhearts)</b><br/><br/>Ever wondered what it would be like to be a teenage monster - and also a member of the mob? Based on the Apocalypse World engine and its Monsterhearts offspring, Mobsterhearts is a narrative rpg game about the messy lives of teenage monsters when they're also mixed up in a life of organised crime. There's nothing the mob hates more than traitors and freaks; so to make it in the Family you'll have to succeed, stay loyal, and silence anyone who suspects your true nature until you can make it to be 'made'.<br/><br/>Mobsterhearts runs with the standard Monsterhearts skins and rules, but with additional mechanics and consequences if you're exposed for what you are. Be wary or be whacked!<br/><br/>GM: Epistolary Richard<br/>Players: 2-3<br/>Slot: Evening                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406000/#Comment_406000" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T01:22:20+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  1:22AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Concrete Cow is less than a month away, with no more cons until then.

There is a light mechanical element that enables players to modify one another's actions and to settle disputes over possible outcomes, but the vast bulk of the game is about playing your characters in scenes with each other and with NPCs handled by the moderator.<br/><i>For 3 or 4 players in the Morning Slot.</i><br/><br/><b>An Anthology of Short Games:</b>There are lots of great games out there than can be played in less than 30 minutes! These are complete, miniature storygames, not demos of longer games: all through the afternoon, I'll be available to facilitate a variety of short games for players who are dropping in and out, arriving late, or just want to pack as many games into one afternoon as they can.<br/><i>For many players in the Afternoon Slot.</i><br/><br/><b>Blood &amp; Water:</b>This is a game heavily drawing it's inspiration from the TV series<i> Being Human</i>: it's about a small group of outcasts and monsters who find solace and acceptance with each other, but how far can their bonds of friendship be tested before they break? The mechanics push strong friendships into a central role, by assuming that as the defaullt state for all the PCs; drawing on these friendships makes you more likely to succeed at actions, but can put your friends at risk. You can reduce the risk to yourself by breaking your friendship with the one who is endangering you, but this makes you less likely to succeed at your own tasks.<br/><i>For 3 or 4 players in the Evening Slot.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406017/#Comment_406017" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T06:17:54+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  6:17AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be bringing along Ribbon Drive (just working on a new set of CD's) and something else I haven't decided yet...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406143/#Comment_406143" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T12:06:16+00:00" title="February 13, 2013 12:06PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

We're now up to <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">15 games on offer for the day</a>. I've listed them below. There's still space for many more, though, so keep them coming!<br/><br/>I've clarified the details of the lunch buffet. Things were complicated by a possible change of owner and a forgetting of the booking, but it all seems to be sorted now. Unfortunately, the price has gone up a whopping 50p to \xa310.00 each. That's still pretty good value for poppadoms, starters, rice, naans, and a choice of three mains. <br/><br/>The final thing to note is a source of possible embarrassment. Concrete Cow makes a small profit, which was never in the plan.

We're now up to a healthy list of twenty games split over seventeen systems (or more, if you include the multitude of indie game demos). The list of all the games is below. <br/><br/>A couple of update highlights.<br/><br/>Simon Burley will be running (and selling copies of) his UK Superhero game, Squadron UK.<br/><br/>The fine folk at <a href="http://www.storyweaver.com/Home.aspx" rel="nofollow">StoryWeaver</a> have donated six vouchers, each good for one of their games. We'll be raffling them off, with the proceeds going to the <a>Alzheimer's Society</a>.<br/><br/>Finally, I recently discovered <a href="http://buskerscoffeeshop.co.uk/www.buskerscoffeeshop.co.uk/Welcome.html" rel="nofollow">Buskers coffee shop</a>, a small, locally-owned, and rather excellent coffee shop. It's about a minute's walk from the Old Bath House and is much better than the large corporate chains. They also serve cakes and light meals. Ask on the day for directions. <br/><br/>As promised, here's the <a>list of games we know about</a>:\n<ul>\n<li> Blood &amp; Water</li>\n<li> Burning Wheel: Dwarves Against the Apocalypse</li>\n<li> Discworld: Postponing the Apocralypse</li>\n<li> Durance</li>\n<li> Fear Itself: The Seventh Circle</li>\n<li> Forsooth!

Two new games are on the list. <br/><br/>One is the first public playtest of Piers Connolly's new game <i>The Facility</i>: "A group of 4 or 5 people are taken from their homes for reasons that are unclear to The Facility, a unit run by 2 Guardians. The Guardians will be able to release one of the Facility's Clients at the end of the session. The Client's goal is to be that one person. The Guardians need to determine what is wrong with all the clients and make recommendations about the ones who have to remain in the Facility."<br/><br/>Rob Alexander will be running some InSpectres (a game inspired by Ghostbusters, but funnier, for those who don't know it).<br/><br/>Also, <a href="http://www.leisuregames.com/" rel="nofollow">Leisure Games</a> will be donating a prize for our first charity raffle. We'll sort out the prize on the day, but I'm sure it will be good!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407084/#Comment_407084" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T11:40:51+00:00" title="February 24, 2013 11:40AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Updates beget more updates. <br/><br/>Another game!
