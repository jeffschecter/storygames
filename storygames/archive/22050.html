I’d encourage you to start a new thread about Catacombatan, and maybe share some of your design.<br/><br/>The lore is interesting: what knowledge about thanatology are you drawing on?<br/><br/>However, mostly I’m curious how you’re using PbtA design in a mystery context, and what the GM’s tools and techniques are.</blockquote>

<b>1. 'Mystery'</b><br/><br/>First you have to know that by 'mysteries of death' I mean not a single, objectively solvable case as in 'murder mystery' but the Greatest Unknown which you can explore on a subjective path. So:
<blockquote>'Something that is difficult or impossible to understand or explain.'</blockquote>
YES!!!
<blockquote>'The secret rites of pagan religion to which only initiates are admitted.'</blockquote>
Definitely yes
<blockquote>'A novel, play, or film dealing with a puzzling crime, especially a murder.'</blockquote>
Not really, maybe as a bit of spice?                        </div>

<b>2. GMing</b><br/><br/>I use a few standard MC principles and moves. The two most important ones (pulled from an SG thread about epicness):<br/><i>Test their convictions!<br/>Everything always intensifies or becomes complicated!</i><br/><br/>The central concept (the Order of Catacombatan) turned out to be more like a link between PCs than the focus of our play. I think 2/3 of our sessions were about the personal life of PCs and not about their organization. Maybe its because there is only one central shared front (Catacombatan) but 3 different outward front (1/PC).<br/><br/>But really, the campaign is also just a good excuse to personally ponder over what is death and how intimate we can get with it.                        </div>

<b>3. Characters</b><br/><br/>The PCs consist of themes (as in <i>The City of Mist</i>), called 'identities' and 'spiritualities' which are functioning as huge flags for the GM.<br/><br/>Every identity has a motto or goal (expressed with an exclamation mark), and every spirituality an enigma or dilemma (expressed with a question mark) which are defined and often redefined by players.<br/><br/>You always have 6 level of themes. If all your themes becomes spiritualities then you depart, transcend or becomes something inhuman.<br/><br/>An example starting character from the campaign:
<blockquote><b>AGOT, THE BASTARD</b><br/>Warrior 3 (identity: 'We came to win!')<br/>Aristocrat 1 (identity: Using my fathers name is glory, shaming it brings death upon me!)<br/>Catacombatan order 1 (identity: I want to know the guardian order better!)<br/><i>Dream 1 (spirituality: Does my life influences my dreams or the other way?)</i></blockquote> </div>

<b>4. Prepping &amp; Setting</b><br/><br/>By looking at the PCs themes I know what kind of prep should I do. For both theme types I try to list challenges and opportunities, basically 'bandoliers of bangs'<br/><br/>As with IRL ones, the settings mysteries usually doesnt have an endpoint, you cannot reach their bottom. There are layers to the truths. Think Call of Cthulhu, but with a less pessimistic tone. The knowledge is often esoteric, circular or synthetic.<br/><br/>The setting was not a true PbtA blank state, it did not originate from provocative questions.<br/><br/>I used a Hungarian setting called Ynev as a base because everyone knows it in Hungary. <br/>I amplified a few elements in it, those which were famously banned from AD&amp;D 2E (assassins, half orcs, demons, poisons, etc). I know its less edgy now but I aimed for a nostalgic 'visceral AD&amp;D feel'. Also in Ynevs greatest city Erion there is a huge necropolis which is cool!<br/><br/>Actually the whole campaign idea originated from a fun fact: in the 80s when Hungarians with poor language skills tried to translate AD&amp;D some groups misunderstood the ability Turn Undead and interpreted it as a way for clerics to turn into undead form!!!<br/><br/>I also work for a monastic religious order and somehow wanted to incorporate it.<br/><br/>So I decided that the campaign will be about a mysterious monastic order who are overseeing the Necropolis, guarding the living from the dead, following various spiritual paths (the 'Faces of Death') and who are also able to turn undead <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Thus the Order of Catacombatan was borne!<br/><br/>So the setting is set but it's history is still very much flexible with huge holes filled out when needed.<br/><br/>I use two methods for that: turning questions back to players (usually about identities), and turning to my knowledge of thanatology for inspiration to convey meaning (usually about spiritualities).<br/><br/>My knowledge of thanatology comes from various sources. Death always fascinated me. I studied a lot about philosophy and world religions, once I was very into the psychology of death, and lately I read a few publications about the historical metaphors and interpretations of death when I studied mental health (courses about grief, mourning, hospice, etc.)<br/> </div>

<b>6. Mysteries that we have found out by playing:</b><br/><br/><b>An example chain of deeper and deeper understanding of an issue </b><br/>- The outer wall of the Necropolis was built in the 4th Era ('The Age of Ignorance'). Why so late? (No answer yet)<br/>- It is also the time when humanity started to use coffins. Maybe as a way to imprison undeads?<br/>- The idea that death is a departure originated from this era (phrases like 'to be gone' or 'depart this life' were neologisms then)<br/>- Actually the fist use of the term 'Gate of Death' comes from this era but it is officially opened in the 2nd Era ('The Age of Resurrection'). How is that?<br/>- Maybe the whole understanding of 'death as space' is a historically new interpretation! But then what the hell The Gate of Death really is?<br/>- Lets look at the 3rd Era (The Golden Age Death). It was filled with personifications of death (Reaper, Dark Angel, Skull)! Why?<br/>- It was because back then the area was full of undead (dans macabres, Headless Horsemen). The deads were living -&gt; Death is living?<br/>- Is the Gate of Death more like a creature or a 'thing'? Can we go deeper than this?<br/><br/><b>A sort of 'murder mystery' parallel to the last one</b><br/>- Were is the guy who got lost in the Necropolis? In the core doing some crazy blood magick shit!<br/>- Why did he do that? He is a Seal Breaker!<br/>- Who are the Seal Breakers? They are a secret society who wants to break the seven seals on The Gate of Death<br/>- How do they want to do that? By blood magick.<br/>- But we protect the gate, right? Unfortunately their members infiltrated the Catacombatan our organization...<br/>- But why there is no investigation about their incursion? Maybe there is one but its secret. or maybe they are already in the top of our organization!<br/><br/><b>Also, an interconnected enigma:</b><br/>- But man, if The Gate of Death is maybe not even a gate, then maybe they know more about its nature than us? Maybe, just maybe we are the 'bad guys'?<br/><br/><b>Finally, an example mystery about a PCs spirituality</b><br/>- Does my life influences my dreams or the other way? Its definitely the other way around!<br/>- What is this repeating motif in my dreams (a sword smashed into a skull)? The symbol of the Order of Catacombatan<br/>- Who is this stranger in my dreams? Its definitely not me and not someone that I know of. (An abandoned enigma)<br/>- What is dream to death? They are sisters! (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnos#/media/File:Waterhouse-sleep_and_his_half-brother_death-1874.jpg" rel="nofollow">Hypnos &amp; Thanatos</a>)<br/>- Can I dream awaken? Sometimes, yes!<br/>- Why do I dream that I am that stranger man? We are connected somehow<br/>- Is this <i>all</i> a dream? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXIyhDsS58I?t=23" rel="nofollow">AFTER 8 SESSIONS OUR CAMPAIGN TURNED QUITE LYNCHIAN TO MY DELIGHT!</a> </div>

                            Very interesting stuff!<br/><br/>I like your approach to developing mysteries and making the game about discovery.<br/><br/>How do these strings of questions come about, in practice?

They originate from the PCs themes. At a lull of play the players can redifine their dilemmas, enigmas, mottoes and goals. As we dont play day by day and skip a lot forward it often happens.<br/><br/>I mostly make the answers up based on my outline. The settings history vaguely mirrors the history of attitude toward death in Europe.<br/><br/>An example: up until the current session I had no idea who l the Sealbreakers are and what they really want. I still dont have the answers but I came up with stakes which will answer it for us in play.                        </div>
