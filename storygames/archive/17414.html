NPCs can be played by anyone who's character is out of the scenes.

You're in charge of hard moves while you're MC. Menaces, Threats, and whatnot can either be ignored or can be communally tracked.

I think Vincent is spot-on: "all you have to do is want to do it."<br/><br/>Harlequin also taught me something: "I imagine this is for groups who just don't have someone who gels with the MC role."<br/><br/>That's cool. I just think the game is ideally played as its designed. That is, with someone as MC who has a creative vision about the situation and characters and is committed to it. That's what's good about an MC/GM. For a long time, for example, I was excited about playing Burning Wheel and Sorcerer but not about GMing them. Then, for both games, I got a creative vision for GMing and am now excited about expressing that through play and seeing how the characters mess about in that. For both games, also, I think that came from playing them as a player, getting my rocks off (to some extent), and then thinking further. Perhaps an MCless group that plays would then spawn an MC or two.<br/><br/>If you don't have that, though, yeah, there are ways to work around it and play the game and have fun.<br/><br/>I ran a bunch of Apocalypse World, because the game made me excited to play and I knew I would have to MC to get it to the table. However, I wasn't as excited about the MC role as the player role, and I think my MCing suffered for it. I burnt out on one game and dropped out. The second game went well, but it would have been better if I had come <b>really</b> raring to MC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394409/#Comment_394409" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T03:20:04+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  3:20AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another reason for considering playing without an MC (bearing in mind I've only played a handful of times) is in oneshots it can actually be a bit jarring to have an MC trying to add a proper plot to the play.

I've written up my take on the approach we ended up following for general interest. It's a one page Reference Sheet designed to be used alongside the MH Player Reference Sheet (and replace the MC sheet).<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9aDy3dv5nWvc3M0Qzk0UGxfMWs/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Monsterheartless</a> - a GM-less variant of Monsterhearts<br/><br/>I should mention that we didn't try out the Story Moves. They're my attempt to better permission/structure the Principles for mcless play. The Play Advice is my attempt to write down the 'unspoken' rules that we were using (we were aided by the fact that we all had MH MC experience).\ufeff<br/><br/>One thing to note is that I don't include mention of Threats/Menaces in this doc as we only had a single session to develop it. One approach, in line with lumpley's advice (above), is to have clear single ownership of them (either by having one player do everything for them or using Archipelago-style aspect ownership). NPCs would be shared in a general pool until they become a Threat, at which point they become owned by the player who owns the Menace. Under both approaches NPCs should still be treated as stolen cars and the players should be fans of the PCs. Another approach would be to avoid single ownership of anything (Microscope-style). Longer term MC-less play needs some trying out to figure what works (at least for me).<br/><br/>semajmaharg also had the idea of using 'The Blood of Misty Harbour' Web of Secrets approach in some manner to support multiple session play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417845/#Comment_417845" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T03:27:34+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  3:27AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff! <br/><br/>I'm curious: what was the level of familiarity with MH/AW in the group?

As an MC in that game my agenda is to complicate things and make sure it's all dark enough and the self-destruction is destructive enough to make things change.<br/><br/>Like, as MC, I really do not give a fuck if your character accomplishes anything whatsoever. (I should be a fan, but that's not the same thing, as anyone who has ever been a fan knows.)  That's <i>your</i> job.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
