Players can acquire parts from cannibalizing other machines or finding them on pieces on their own. The more parts required, the longer it takes to fashion the machine. Works great in theory but I've hit a snag and I can't sort it out. <br/><br/>The problem is a have a lot of information for each item and its making it difficult to sort out how to set the parts cost. I've been racking my brain for over an hour on this and I have no idea what to do. Most of the info feels necessary, so I'll list what it is and you can be the judge. <br/><br/>Weight: How much the item weighs<br/>Range: how far away it can be used from<br/>Target: How many people it can effect <br/>Charges: How may uses it has<br/>Parts: The # of parts it contains <br/>Damage: How much damage it does<br/>Unique bonus: Any special bonus it bestows the player, including dice bonuses. <br/><br/>With all of this information, I'm not sure how to establish how much worth any particular item should have. Non-weapon items contain only some of that information, but can possess better bonuses and depending on what the item is, the bonuses can fluctuate. Its given me a real headache. <br/><br/>Any suggestions?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448922/#Comment_448922" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T19:49:02+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  7:49PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2015 7:49PM by James_Mullen.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming at this from complete ignorance, why not the following:<br/><br/> &gt; Each point of Range, Target, Charges, Damage and Bonus = 1 Part: these points don't have to be on a linear scale, e.g. 1 point of Targets might effect 1 person, while 2 points effects up to 5 and so on.<br/><br/> &gt; The number of Parts = the Weight, but you can use Fine Parts or Rugged Parts: the former are lighter but require finer engineering (2 Points = 3 Fine Parts, but 3 Fine Parts = 1 Weight), while the latter are bulky &amp; crude (3 Points = 2 Rugged Parts, but 2 Rugged Parts = 4 Weight)<br/><br/> &gt; The Fine &amp; Rugged options let you trade off the availability of Parts against the portability of the device and vice versa.<br/><br/>That keeps it simple and does most of the calculations for you: I imagine it would break for some specialist devices with significant powers (a force field belt and a time travel belt might have the same Weight and Parts) but you can always compensate for that with Powers that have modifiers, e.g. "requires x1.5 Parts" or "Weightx2."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ver_Spot" title="Ver_Spot"><img alt="Ver_Spot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ver_Spot">Ver_Spot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448924/#Comment_448924" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T20:47:54+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  8:47PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great suggestion.

The important part is that <i>number</i> (whether it's a mod, a stat, a "part" or whatever).  Thinking this way allows you to lump lots of things together in classes by numbers, paying little attention to the fictional description (which will come from the Players and your own ideas).  This gives you a tremendulous amount of freedom in describing things.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448926/#Comment_448926" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T21:11:42+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  9:11PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Abstraction. Reduce the complexity of an item to a score. Very complex items have more parts. However, very high scores can be reduced (to a small degree) if you have extra parts. Each part reduces the complexity a little bit.<br/><br/>Player: "I want to make a steam heart regulator."<br/>GM: "That's a fairly complex thing. Complexity 10."<br/>Player: "Um. I'll never succeed. Uh, I have a box full of gears and a finely machined valve plus the pump mechanism that the old man gave us."<br/>GM: "The gears reduce the complexity by 1, as does the pump. The valve is finely machined, so that reduces it by 2. You're at complexity 6 now."<br/>Player: "Doable... with a little luck."<br/><br/>The idea is that players collect stuff and record it on their sheet, not knowing what it's useful for. When they want to build stuff, they get to suggest how it's useful. You don't need to decide <i>a priori</i> that a steam heart regulator needs gears, a valve, and a pump. Players have to make the case that those components are useful for the regulator. <br/><br/>Components like a box of gears is probably useful for everything! Components like a "left-handed squirm gear" and a "temperature activated steam drill" are probably useful only in special Steampunk Macguyver situations.<br/><br/>(This is just a flavor of my component magic system.

If I were playing a steampunk engineering game, I would like the engineering to be as meaningful as possible, taking me as close as it can to the science fiction threshold of "and putting everything together, it does something marvelous and impossible" without necessarily demanding technically advanced design efforts. <br/>Reserves of cheap simple components could allow some abstractions to avoid wasting roleplaying time on boring stuff.<br/>For example, the battery could be an exotic artifact and the rails could be expensive or built wrong, but everything else needed to shoot the TEA laser rifle could be easily designed and built in any reasonable laboratory with a modest risk of electrocution. <br/><br/>There's also the other variation axis of custom-made parts (for example, the TEA laser rifle calls for precisely aligned polished aluminium rails on an elegantly ornamented hardwood frame) vs. found parts (for example, the TEA laser rifle could be built with straightened and smoothed iron bars from a window, losing some output power, and with a recycled crossbow body, losing a little mechanical robustness and/or accuracy).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ver_Spot" title="Ver_Spot"><img alt="Ver_Spot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ver_Spot">Ver_Spot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448936/#Comment_448936" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-08T12:18:53+00:00" title="October  8, 2015 12:18PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting concept.
