They <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9lO2qIN1mc" rel="nofollow">organized up a little game day</a> where, to my great surprise and delight, all my games got played.  I facilitated a game of Fiasco and a chapter of Grey Ranks, and a game of The Roach was played in Italiano - I think it went well; there was a lot of screaming.  Everybody was extraordinarily welcoming and kind, and I'm very excited about the connections we made. <br/><br/>It's always really interesting to be a part of a different culture of play.  In the case of the folks I played with in Chivasso, there was a much greater emphasis on fellowship over "productivity", and it shocked me to realize how hard we push at our local house-cons - squeezing in as much gaming as possible at the expense of simple socialization.  This was a great lesson for me, and now I want to host a Relaxicon where sharing meals and enjoying each others company as friends has equal billing with whatever games get played.  This may be a good topic for its own thread.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233293/#Comment_233293" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T12:09:33+00:00" title="September 20, 2009 12:09PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great video.  What a strong touchstone shared imagination is.<br/><br/>I haven't been to many cons but my last couple I had at least one slot open for relaxing and hopefully socializing.  Relaxicon sounds wonderful but most Americans will never be like most Italians in this regard.  That's part of the reason it's perhaps my favorite vacation destination, along with other laidback cultures.<br/><br/>My Sunday group shares a meal and great conversation before every game and usually wraps things up early so we can shoot the breeze for a little while after.

And a big part of that was the delicious meal that Johannes and Anne prepared for us yesterday evening - just sitting around the dinner table, sharing a great, tasty meal and talking about this and that after having played great games was extremely enjoyable. It isn't rocket science but it's one hell of an important realization for me. Roleplaying, after all, is a social THING (couldn't think of a better word - tired after three days of gaming) and oftentime quiate intimate. Sharing a meal helps strengthen the bonds we've created.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233296/#Comment_233296" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T12:35:50+00:00" title="September 20, 2009 12:35PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remi reminded me that we (Durham 3) share a meal before we play, and that over time that has stretched out into an hour or more these days.

We played a game of Fiasco with 4 out of 5 of the players roleplaying in a second language, and 3 out of 5 who never read the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had fun, we had a very sad and melancholic story in a western town with an ex-robber Sheriff, a crime-lord banker, a not-very-heroic deputy and his cheating but loving wife. The language barrier meant a slower game, but it worked and I'm very happy for that. Jason confirmed that our not-so-perfect language did not impair the enjoyement for him too. I hope to find some time to write a longer AP report soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe (short) game of The Roach was very (very) loud and wild, and piqued my interest to play it again: it seems to really have good potential as a party game too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my friends were happy with the Gray Ranks game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "relaxicon" aspect I guess came pretty much naturally: it's not like we planned to have time to play and enough time to socialize, and stuff. I guess it's just the way we'd do this. Also, having Jason and Autumn experience some good Italian food was one of our priorities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233308/#Comment_233308" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T15:28:08+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  3:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2009 3:39PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Also, having Jason and Autumn experience some good Italian food was one of our priorities.</blockquote>\nYour priorities were in order, sir.  And the English at the table was very good.  It felt like the guy with the weakest (relative) language skills ended up playing a more minor role - he played the wife, a very interesting but passive character - and still seemed to have fun.<br><br>More on the Fiasco session <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10513" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233586/#Comment_233586" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T03:24:05+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  3:24AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did Autumn play in any games, ya know besides <i>Molesto la Gatto</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233590/#Comment_233590" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T04:37:38+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  4:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, she spent the day in Torino <i>Molesto la Muji.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
