Ie. Make a simple set (say about 5) of Relevant questions that<br/>bring out a awesome from some idea, and name it like X - Burner and post it here.<br/><br/>My feeble starter:<br/><br/><b>The Lost Soul - Burner</b><br/>..

But I've seen the "world burner" in <i>Burning Empires</i>, and it looks to me like a series of options from which the group selects in order to determine the parameters of the setting. Don't get me wrong; it's still a series of questions, but they're multiple-choice rather than open-ended. So think of the tables I presented as just another way of asking questions: "What are the surface conditions like on this world? The inhabitants? The government?"<br/><br/>If that were all, then my response would fail on the grounds that it doesn't drive toward story potential, which seems to be your complaint. But it's clear that you can't stop with the closed-set responses to the prompting questions: you have to create the little narrative description that tells you what that combination of responses means. At that point you've got a world you can land on.<br/><br/>In short: don't let the format fool you. A "random" set of tables is as much a "burner" as anything else--if you're committed to making sense of the results as hooks toward story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107477/#Comment_107477" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T23:20:18+00:00" title="November  8, 2007 11:20PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll play!<br/><br/>I haven't read BE yet, but the Clan Burner in <i>Blossoms are Falling</i> is made of Win.
