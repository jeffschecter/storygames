Most every GM I have ever seen uses their own form of shorthand when it comes to NPC stats. This has me wondering, why give them Stats at all?<br/><br/>Naturally, the GM will need to give them some sort of mechanical weight within the system, be it a dice pool, a skill bonus, an attribute total, or a level. Why detail them any more than this?<br/><br/>Having just wrapped up a ten month World of Darkness game, I noticed my NPCs got less and less detailed. By game's end, NPCs looked like this:\n<blockquote>SWAT Dude, Rank 4<br/>Skill Pool: 8<br/>Health: 9 *Rank + 5*<br/>Attack: Sub-Machine Gun (+3 damage)</blockquote>\nRank was my quick reference for the NPC's weight within the story, from 1 to 5. When the NPC needed to roll, it rolled a Skill Pool of Rank x 2 dice. When I needed the NPC's Strength, Intelligence or Firearms, I just used the NPC's Rank. Naturally, any 1-10 stats within the World of Darkness system (Willpower, Blood Potency, etc) were Rank x 2. I made a few notes for the types of attack or damage the NPC used and I was done! <br/><br/>*Beyond these very basic stats, everything is simply color. By this system, SWAT Dude would technically roll 8 dice should he ever decide to translate an occult tome. Of course, he'll never actually do that because that's not the roll he plays in the story. The most detail I could imagine justifying would be giving an NPC "Expertise" equal to Rank x 2 and giving an "Unskilled" rating equal to Rank. SWAT Dude rolls 8 dice for anything SWAT related, but 4 dice for anything else.*<br/><br/>Compare this to something like The Mountain Witch. <i>Every</i> NPC in tMW rolls the exact same 1d6 as the Player Characters do. NPCs are simply given a rating of "Weak" or "Strong" to indicate how difficult it is to defeat the threat. <i>No one</i> would complain that sparsely detailed antagonists in The Mountain Witch make the game any less fun!\n<blockquote><cite>Mountain Witch, p.105</cite><b>Skeletons</b><br/>Like in Western legends, living skeletons are... [fluff regarding Skeletons as symbols of Death]<br/>Strength: Weak</blockquote>\nThat's it! There's nothing else to a Mountain Witch antagonist besides it's 'weight' within the fiction. The only thing that matters is how long it takes to put the thing down and how roughed up you're likely to get as a result.<br/><br/>If it works for tMW, why should I be statting NPCs in other games? What am I missing by not giving NPCs mechanical range by making them skilled at some things and unskilled at others? Why does this matter in Game X if it doesn't make a difference in Mountain Witch?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238214/#Comment_238214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T15:48:26+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  3:48PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to agree with you, but to play Devil's Advocate.<br/><br/>Firstly, you say it's "simply colour" (although you leave out the 'u'), but colour is really important.

Especially so when there's no big book o' enemies. I usually stat all foes for one session in a given superhero RPG to get a feel for the the mechanics before just giving them a "level" (same thing as your rank really) and leaving it at that. <br/><br/>In games where tactics are important, it definitely is nice to have more detailed NPCs, but if that's the case *I* as the GM don't want to do the work as much... so I'm more likely to wing it (again, if there's a monster manual type thing, I'll often use the stats from there, since they're pre-set) <br/><br/>Still, at least in traditional games, I think it's kind of assumed you'll develop a "shorthand" for NPCs eventually, which ends up making the complexity of foes a sliding range based on your preferences rather than something set in stone by the designer. Although if this was an intentional choice, it would be nice to possibly have the different levels explicitly stated so that people don't have to wing it with potentially un-fun results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238220/#Comment_238220" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T16:14:58+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  4:14PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, good point for bringing up Vincent's blog post.<br/><br/>In any system with complex characters, I have always had a range of NPCs, from those who never get a character sheet at all, to those who get a small number of stats noted, to those who get a full workup. Characters who don't have mechanical input don't need a character sheet (or at least one that has mechanical notes on it - as Vincent implies, we might still make some notes such as name, occupation, location, etc.). Characters who will only be peripherally involved may just need a few numbers.<br/><br/>Having recently played Burning Wheel I appreciate how it provides suggestions of how to write up simple NPCs.<br/><br/>And as Graham notes, it can be important that an NPC have more detail. If we can discern from fictional role, it may be easy to come up with a number on the spot, but perhaps it makes sense to come up with more detail ahead of time.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vinyard is another interesting example. NPCs are not assigned numbers ahead of time, but when necessary, there is a process to give them a set of numbers.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238228/#Comment_238228" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T17:08:39+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  5:08PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, tactics. There's a good point. I shy away from tactical games so that aspect of NPCs totally slipped my mind. In a game like 4E, it's really nice to know an antagonist's different Defenses and weaknesses. That makes a lot of sense. You want enemies that are killer at range, but pushovers in melee and the like.<br/><br/>Aside from tactics heavy games though, I still don't see the point. The difference between Submachine Gun 19 and Intelligence 3 is roleplayed easily enough. And honestly, I think it's the roleplaying of these non-combat traits that often has more game effect than the actual numbers.<br/><br/>How many GMs make an attempt to accurately roleplay the opponent's Intelligence or Charisma? Think about it a bit more. Are they really roleplaying the stat on the opponent's sheet or are they roleplaying the image of the character they have in mind?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238232/#Comment_238232" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T17:49:23+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  5:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because making up NPC stats is fun?<br/><br/>I mean, if you're asking why people would ever do it, the answer is, because it's fun, and it's the only time the GM gets to do character creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238244/#Comment_238244" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T19:50:09+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  7:50PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contra, JD, I find making up NPC stats the most tedious part of prepping fora  session.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I always do it.

NPC stats aren't always as useless as Graham's 'u'.<br/><br/>Reducing NPC stats is a refinement (like removing unnecessary letters from words) not a clue that they secretly aren't needed.  It depends a lot on the game how little is actually needed, or whether they are needed at all.<br/><br/>I had a recent realization with Little Fears, after getting the new edition. I had been looking forward to monsters having their own stats. The original had PCs use their own stats on a pass/fail test to see if they beat/escaped a monster. I saw the monster sheet, and saw how big it was and thought, "Wait, I've since played games where NPCs had no stats and just used PC skills on a pass fail!  Was the older way better?" The answer I came to was "no".  Little Fears was about fighting monsters that adults could not see, but were still "real" and dangerous. They're also supposed to be powerful and threatening, and the way the system worked, being based off the child PC's stats did not help them feel like an external threat and helped reinforced an idea that they might be imaginary after all.<br/><br/>There's also a quote in Diaspora I agree with, opposing rolls are fun.  You don't need NPC stats to get that. HeroQuest uses opposing rolls for everything. And I make up my NPC stats in HQ on the fly. I do this in Spirit of the Century too, and could do it for World of Darkness. Does that mean I'm not using NPC stats? I don't think so.  I am using criteria more than story importance.  If the opponents are getting into a sword fight with sword fighters, then the opposition will be harder. If they try to sneak past, run away from, or trick sword fighters, then it's probably going to be easier.  This is more than a "weak" label, and in a sense the NPCs have a limitless number of potential stats, but I'll never need to bring more than a couple to bear for most of them. But having the stats introduces not just color, but also variety in the conflict. In a game like 4E, variety and tactics in the conflict is the major component of the game.<br/><br/>But then there are games like Primetime Adventures where varied external opposition is not important and what matters is what's happening to the character (the PC).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238251/#Comment_238251" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T21:21:27+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  9:21PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent also has good things to say in the new, optional rules for Dogs NPCs.

Statting out NPCs in World of Darkness, for example, is usually not worth the work for me. The stats don't really add that much. Most of the time I'll use a shorthand instead. (Like that out of the SAS books.) <br/><br/>On the other hand, systems which force you to focus or have steps that drive you outside your normal patterns for character creation can make it worth my while. When I make NPCs for Burning Wheel, for example, the lifepath system will often get me to make characters who are different -- from a characteristics and background POV -- than characters I would have made if I hadn't forced them most of (if not all) the way through the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238355/#Comment_238355" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T10:03:18+00:00" title="October 20, 2009 10:03AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarvis</cite>If it works for tMW, why should I be statting NPCs in other games?</blockquote>\nBecause otherwise you dehumanize them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238357/#Comment_238357" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T10:17:14+00:00" title="October 20, 2009 10:17AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, that hits on something I wrestle with myself.

Regardless of ingame portrayals the game rules mechanically divided the world into "full people" and "not full people".

In Spirit of the Century, many bad guys are just mooks and are really nothing more than stress boxes (although they can have aspects). And some bad guys are fully statted out (perhaps too much so). You can do the same in White Wolf, and if you're like me, do have more detail on your more major NPCs. Those NPCs (hopefully) end up producing a lot more flavor and color, and probably more complex character choices and interaction as well.<br/><br/>And perhaps some games are wrong. Perhaps Dogs in the Vineyard is not doing NPCs in the best way. I know White Wolf games, D&amp;D 3.x, SotC and many other games are way off the mark with their NPCs (since they usually instruct, or imply, NPCs are made just like PCs). So, just because DitV has a strikingly different method doesn't mean it's right.

As you've said before, Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom are excellent RPG hooks for NPCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238522/#Comment_238522" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T05:59:10+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  5:59AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jarvis, just because a character is memorably characterized doesn't mean he or she is doing anything to drive a game's situations or conflicts.<br/><br/>Also, I don't think it's "numbers," exactly, about which some of us are talking.  Traits, Beliefs, Spiritual Attributes--it's about knowing what's driving a character, and how those elements push against what the players want to accomplish.  But there are less quantifiable elements--like those pages of culture and ecology in the old D&amp;D Monstrous Compendium entries--that put one in the other guy's shoes.  At the end of a ten-month campaign, probably it matters little what a SWAT Officer's Virtue and Vice are.  But somewhere in the process of determining, recognizing these things, an important part of roleplaying games happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238989/#Comment_238989" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T10:38:00+00:00" title="October 24, 2009 10:38AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Statting up NPCs for fun is not something I have time for. I tend to look at each and every number or descriptor and ask myself, "will I use in the game?" If the answer is "no", it's out of there. <br/><br/>What I DO like, though, is: <br/><br/>a) anything that makes me learn more about the NPC. For instance, the "what do the NPCs want?" step in Dogs is critical. Some mechanical choices can have this impact, too.<br/>b) anything that helps me remember what the NPC is like from session to session and bring that out in play. Again, some mechanics/stats do this; most do not.<br/><br/>I think Dave Berg, above, already said all this better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
