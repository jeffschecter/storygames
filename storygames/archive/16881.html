I am assuming you're all Americans who care personally about religion. Or who are atheists and pedophiles, you know, because these things go together. Or maybe you're Europeans who are REALLY godless. <br/><br/>Now that we've got everyone on board with that respectful intro: Have you played any games incorporating Jesus? I think there are a lot of interesting ways to approach Jesus in a gaming context - one way would be, as in "Heads of State", to make a series of mini-games highlighting very different aspects of the whole phenomenon. For instance:<br/><br/>- A short story-telling game where the disciples related the same episode through different eyes<br/>- A debating game where different religious authorities tried to shape the biography of the Saviour<br/>- A game about personal choices for Jesus - who do you save? how do you relate to your mortality?<br/>- A game about the Second Coming, where Jesus arrives in our world and things happen from there<br/>- A game about a historical, non-magical Jesus who is the leader of a guerrilla tribe somewhere in the Middle East thousands of years ago                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384731/#Comment_384731" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T13:15:06+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  1:15PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We set a Zombie Cinema game in Palestine at the turn of the millennia, and the card draws clearly indicated we were playing Jesus, Mary and Judas.

We deliberately misinterpreted his hints ("Hey, guys, who are those guys who were around thousands of years ago?") and organised a Jewish-themed party instead. <br/><br/>Then we decided that, to make our party the best party ever, we needed the most famous Jewish man ever. That, we decided, was Jesus, and so we transported him to the party in a time machine. The highlight of the party was when he danced into the middle of the floor and flirted with the Dean.<br/><br/>It later emerged that the GM was a Christian and had found all this rather difficult.

While I did play it in the wilds of Canada I don't think it was in the same game since this one was organized as a playtest of the rules by the author.  I'm glad to see it get a little play elsewhere.
