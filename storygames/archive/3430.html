The reason, the author speculates, is that while the rule makes for more exciting and tense interaction, the target audience - families - don't actually want that level of tension.<br/><br/>Huh. I remember reading the rule. And I don't remember ever playing with it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary" title="Martin O'Leary"><img alt="Martin O'Leary" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary">Martin O'Leary</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77329/#Comment_77329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T09:47:39+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  9:47AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The funny thing is, we drifted Monopoly all over the place as kids, but I don't recall ever changing that rule.

In my family, we always used the auction rule. What's interesting is that my grandfather, who taught us the game was very strict about reading and playing by the rules without variation. He couldn't play with <b>his</b> at all. Apparently the games years before had turned out in the mess of hurt feelings, exactly as the author of the article posited. None of his children, even as adults, would sit down to a game of Monopoly with him. <br/><br/>When we grandchildren were old enough, he taught us to play, and it seems to have worked out well enough. I suspect the difference was that he took time to explain his thinkning and strategies of play to us, where he didn't with his own children.<br/><br/>Eventually, the lot of us learned to beat the Old Man consistently. We also learned how to clean him out at Poker and Black Jack. :-)<br/><br/>On a tangent, this might also have an interesting tie back to rpgs and their popularity and sources of conflict between players.<br/><br/>One of the early "selling  points" of rpgs to me was the existence of both challenge, but the lack of a <i>one winner takes all </i>sensibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kintara" title="Kintara"><img alt="Kintara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kintara">Kintara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77357/#Comment_77357" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T14:22:30+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  2:22PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2007 2:27PM by Kintara.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait. People actually passed on buying property? That's new to me. I always bought everything I landed on. And if I didn't have the cash on hand, I'd sell all my houses and mortgage all my property to do it. And I don't really ever remember having a problem doing this. I always had enough money to at least buy the unsold properties I landed on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, why wouldn't you? It gives you the power to block someone else from getting a monopoly. It gives you a safe spot to land on. It gives you bargaining chips for trading the property you want. And if no one owns any of the other properties yet, then you still have a chance to take them all without having to resort to trading anything of yours away. Every single property on the board is worth buying if it's still unsold by the time you land on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell, the auction rule, if anything, strengthens my position on this. I'm not going to let someone else own something I landed on. Are you crazy? I do vaguely remember using this rule, and mostly thinking that the people I was playing with were crazy for passing up on a property.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77399/#Comment_77399" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T23:20:48+00:00" title="June 24, 2007 11:20PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another reason might be, that no one ever reads the rules.
