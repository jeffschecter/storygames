<p>Counterpart to <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2091" rel="nofollow">Japanese Plastic Books</a>.</p>
<p>So, a lot of boardgames come with their rules printed on like a couple of folded sheets of paper, often cheaply so, in black-and-white even when they are describing crucial colourcoding things that go on in the game and such.</p>
<p>The message these pamphlets communicate to me is, "You can easily learn these rules by heart and <em>lose this pamphlet</em> and everything will be okay." The physical record of the rules is an encumbrance/afterthought, rather than an object of reference and fetishistic interest.</p>
<p>Where are the disposable RPGs? It occurs to me that games like Polaris, 1001 Nights, and Mridangam would need only a trivial amount of work, mostly in the way of better-designed play aids (spiritual cousins of gameboards), to become disposable-rules games.</p>

<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/unistat.pdf" rel="nofollow">Unistat</a> was has that sort of vibe (that the artifact containing the rules is ultimately disposable). It's designed to print on a single sheet of paper and fold like a booklet. After you play it once, you shouldn't ever need the booklet again. You certainly could have it around when you play, of course...if you really need to reference one of the <i>four </i>rules. Honestly, I think I could explain the entire game in under ten minutes. Heck, you should be able to figure most of it out by watching a few minutes of play.                        </div>

I gotcha, and I think you are dead-on about the perceived value with the coffee-table books.<br/><br/>Now, this may be a side issue, but how do you think that the sort of general gamer-culture aversion to physical goodies plays into this?<br/><br/>I've heard terms like "too board-gamelike" applied as a negative on several occasions to games mechanics, and I've certainly known people to apparently discount games as rpgs based on the necessity of things like maps or miniatures.<br/><br/>Your general thoughts?                        </div>

                            Hmmm, my general thoughts? Some gamers are extremly conservative and very likely to decree anything as "Not an RPG" that is different from what they know. Wether those are "average gamers" or some extreme fringe mostly found on gaming boards is up for discussion and we could probably argue about that for years (Which would be boring, so we shouldn't start.), but at the very least they are a <i>vocal</i> minority and so they tend to get heard, especially as they are also generally reliable customers.<br/><br/>Which is an ugly dilemma, IMO, likely to leave a game that tries a different modell of publication without a consumer base as "regular gamers" might not buy it and "regular people" might not know about it in the first place.<br/><br/>M                        </div>

What sort of play aids were you thinking of, more specifically, shreyas?<br/><br/>You mentioned 1001 Nights. I thought immediately of ways that could use play aids in the form of a stylized board ( or playmats) for it when I read it.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking of stuff along the lines of the old <i>King of the Tabletop</i> game by Tom Wham (later issued as the <i>Kings and Things </i>boardgame) with it's play mats.<br/><br/>This does get back to the concern I mentioned upthread about something being too "boardgame-like" though.<br/><br/>Can you throw us an example of what you were thinking of?<br/><br/>Edit to add:<br/>Jason Morningstar:<br/>The Chris Engle rules are almost a classic example of stuff where the rules are so brief and easily learned that they can be "disposed of" after a couple read throughs. I understand that this is the thinking behind Chris E. selling specific uses of the rules ( the various games) rather than bothering to sell thr rules themselves.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, can you clear up what it is you do want? Because I'm not sure exactly what element of play aids you want to talk about.                        </div>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>Are you referring to the fact that most boardgames and such don't require the written rules for reference because the actual play pieces and the board generally serve as play aids and reminders to what the rules are?  Monopoly, for one example, has many little instructions written on the board to serve tell the players what to do at times.  If this is what you are talking about, how would you see this being addressed since most (not all) role-playing games don't come with playing pieces at all except for maybe character sheets?                        </div>

<p>This question answers itself. Andrew, this leads into where I was going before.</p>
<p><em>RPG play aids are bad.</em> Somehow, we have failed to internalise the physical lessons that boardgame designers take for granted. So, like, what <em>are</em> these lessons in the first place, and how do we apply them? Maybe we can take a game and design play aids for it, with the aim of eliminating as much of its rules text as possible.</p>

                            Okay.  Here's some play aids I've come across over the years for D&amp;D.  I have no idea how effective they were or how viable they ended up being from a financial standpoint for TSR.<br/><br/>1.) GM screens.  Key rules summarized on a prop that lots of DM's used anyway.<br/>2.) Spell cards.  These were printed, index-sized cards that held information for each spell.  Just hand them out to your players who have the spells.<br/>3.) Specialized Character Sheets.  Specialized information for specific classes included right on the sheet.<br/>4.) Magic Item cards.  See Spell cards above only these are for magical items.<br/><br/>Obviously things that work for D&amp;D won't necessarily be appropriate for other games.  After all, who needs specialized character sheets for The Pool?  Are these the kinds of things you're talking about or have I gone down some other rabbit trail?<br/><br/>As far as designing play aids for an existing game, I think it might be easier to design a game from the ground up with the intention of using these kinds of aids rather than jury rig something to fit a game not designed for it.                        </div>

                            Gaerik,<br/>  I think what Shreyas is talking about is more like putting an XP bar that the player fills in on the character sheet.  But not just that: going on to remove that section from the book because it is now redundant.<br/>  I think I'm getting what Shreyas is saying: with well-designed play aids, why do we need enormous volumes to contain the game text?  To use the monopoly example, some game designers might create lists of property values, cross-referenced with rent values and relative locations and the accordant rules to go with them-- page count 150+.  Parker Brothers instead included a board which has all of this information on it (graphically), and the rules occupy a single page.<br/><br/>On a side note, I think the reason for the strong aversion of some roleplayers to play aids is two-fold.  One is community and identification; to set "our" games apart from "those" games.  This is usually couched in some mumbo-jumbo about how any play aid/board/cards constrains the immagination and leads to inferior play.  The second reason is practical: any play aid has to be schlepped to the play-site, and if it's vital to the game (like the board in Monopoly) forgetting it means no play.  Less stuff is less stuff to keep track of.                        </div>

<p><em>Exactly.</em></p>
<p>I think you've pointed out the heart of the aversion. Now I must go get my knife, because we are going to stab it. (iow, the typical RPG book is a play aid too, and it's a <em>much bigger and less useful</em> one than boardgamey bits, and I think we all know how I feel about the absurdity of gamer identity politics.)</p>
