"It's too easy".<br/><br/>They dislike abstract  wealth mechanics. They want to know how much things cost in dollars. They want to know the minutia. They want to be rewarded for having the right tool for the right job. They want to be rewarded for careful planning. In Shadowrun, they love that specific clothing gives you a bonus to social interactions with specific people. They love buying different sets of clothes for different occasions.<br/><br/>So here is what I did:<br/><br/>- I told them their characters have X money in american dollars.<br/>- Go online, buy anything you want using that money.<br/>- If it's something that would be illegal in our game, times the price by 5.<br/>- If it's something that would be rare in our game, times the price by 10.<br/>- Keep a detailed list of everything you buy, what it does, and how much maintenance costs.<br/>- They can only have what they can carry. <br/><br/>Then in game if their equipment gives them a clear advantage (and we are very strict about this, any player at the table can veto it) they gain a +1 to their roll and if they fail, they can permanently junk the equipment to gain a mixed success. <br/><br/>We then convert Barter into some dollar amount, just for these players to buy new things.<br/><br/>After each game, they must pay the maintenance cost of their equipment or junk it. They must also check to ensure they can carry everything they have. Otherwise they have to junk some of it.<br/><br/>They love it.<br/><br/>Everyone else plays the rules as written.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379913/#Comment_379913" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T07:03:59+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  7:03AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 7:04AM by Wilhelm.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I have written games with the expressed purpose of removing that element of play. :-)<br/><br/>But good thing about the "go online" bit, then they can do their shopping between sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379916/#Comment_379916" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T07:15:57+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  7:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally I prefer games where I don't have to deal with this sort of play.<br/><br/>Part of my method above is to encourage my friends who love that to participate while making them do all the work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379917/#Comment_379917" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T07:19:58+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  7:19AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last time I played more than a one-shot of D&amp;D (3.5) I was really interested in having piecemeal armor for my character, enough so that I wrote up a set of piecemeal armor rules. The DM approved them, and tho they were technically "available to everyone" I was the only one who wanted to use them. I ended up having, like, a little worse AC but fewer penalties than having the equivalent normal armor. It really didn't have an effect on play, but I got to feel special, and it also gave me a reason to actually care about my opponents kit (cuz I could potentially use it to upgrade something).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379919/#Comment_379919" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T07:24:38+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  7:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pretty great.

Throughout the game, you manage your money to buy clothes. You wear certain clothes in certain sub-districts to become more powerful: Like if you want to fight monsters in the really upscale section, you need to be wearing $12000 suits or you'll be at a small disadvantage. There's punk gear, hippie gear, cute/simple gear, hip hop gear, beachware gear, athletic gear, etc. You wear clothes in various combos (usually picking out outfits from similar components) in order to more easily use powers and fight monsters. And each category of gear has its opposite. Like the Armani Suits and Rolexes would be opposed to the beachwear, etc.<br/><br/>There's also a sub-mechanic where the clothes you wear repeatedly can also change the fashion of that sub-district, and more people who look like you show up, and the fashion in that district slowly shifts towards you. But that's a side thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, it kinda got my brain working in that direction. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if the internet route as above would appeal to me, but I'd try it once I think. And I've definitely come around on shopping systems, especially when you can do things like buy outfits or esoteric gear that actually affects your various skills: Eric Provost was working on a kind of Shadowrun/Cyberpunk hack with purchasable gear, where buying $1000 worth of "something" gains you a +2 skill bonus. So a cologne, scarf or awesome full-body estee/spa treatment and haircut could give you +2 to cologne. Or self-created "reactive-spring carbon composite parkour gloves" can give you a +2 to athletics or climbing, etc. Even though that's not so much a "laundry list" of stuff you pick from but rather narrate yourself, you do it from a pool of money and not a wealth rating, and each bit of equipment really says something about your character.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379977/#Comment_379977" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T16:12:28+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  4:12PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For something like that you could also check out <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/2010/12/bury-yourself-in-metropole-luxury.html" rel="nofollow">Metropole Luxury Coffin</a>.

It's post-aopcalyptic. The system rewards the use of equipment (along the lines of 1 die for no equipment, 2 for having equipment, skill lowers the difficulty number) and the taking of risks (Extra dice for taking a risk but if you fail you face worse consequences). Characters sheets have a grid to show how much equipment each PC is carrying. You print out the equipment and line it up on the grid, like in a CRPG. You can get bags which give you further grids and there's also weight (which is just a number). It's a nice little game. There's a review of it <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11648.phtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There was an (idiosyncratic) English translation but it never got picked up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380361/#Comment_380361" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T14:18:40+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  2:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I always disliked shopping for equipment and keeping track of it, but it turned out my wife loved that aspect of play when - and this was the important part - she could afford what she wanted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380365/#Comment_380365" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T14:48:12+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  2:48PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my "shopping games" was part of my systemless post-apoc hack, Vancouver (which has been played with Top Secret, Twilight: 2000, and probably others I've forgotten -- Aftermath, I'm sure) in which the focal point of character generation was gear selection. In this phase each player received a single blank sheet of paper and was asked to write on it everything the character owns. The player then hands it to the ref who crosses off everything that doesn't work for her. I know, sounds heavy-handed, but this was the 80s. Yikes, maybe the 70s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the game wound up being about what you could get on the page that the ref *wouldn't notice*. In one case an apparently irrelevant doodle contained "fully loaded F-15" hidden within it. In another a swirl of Tengwar turned out to read "basket of grenades".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380368/#Comment_380368" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T15:05:12+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  3:05PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came across this yesterday, which seems appropriate here: <a href="http://timdenee.com/thisisanadventure/" rel="nofollow">http://timdenee.com/thisisanadventure/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380369/#Comment_380369" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T15:15:18+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  3:15PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if the fact that scarcity is a critical element to post-apocalyptic genres has something to do with this.

I wanted to make gear interesting and important in my dungeon crawly campaign, so I started my players off poor and under-geared (kind of made the murder hobo thing literal). So when they saved the baker from the animated animal cracker beasts and she rewarded them with meat pies and some other rations, it was significant. <br><br>And as a GM, seeing the players be happy with meager barter items as rewards was fun.<br/><br/>But scarcity isn't the only thing. When I wrote an article about identifying player motives, one of the motives I identified was Versatility - the ability to collect important things (items, spells, lore, favors, etc) and have the right thing at the right time. Being able to do that in a game is a big thrill for some players in some games.<br/><br/>I think that versatility motive is a not-uncommon drive among players. But it's one that can be a little tricky for a GM to implement sometimes. It often takes a lot of work on the GM's part. That's a big part of why Jenskot's idea is so compelling - it allows you to satisfy the itch without burdening the GM.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380409/#Comment_380409" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T02:59:44+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  2:59AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scarcity is a viable element of suspense and it's been useful in post-apocalyptic games I've run.<br/>\nI used to run a messed-up version of the Morrow Project where hapless players from Today awoke from cryosleep in a devastated future and had to deal with a random assortment of initial materials left behind by a succession of confused bureaucrats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fun part of games like that was seeing what items the players did collect and what they thought they could loot when they got the chance.<br/>\nAlso, it's interesting how many times Moldy Porn became an important trade item with the various enclaves of survivors.
