Don\u2019t fancy a spell on the prison planet? No problem, go and do a degree at Weber College, the fustiest, dustiest learning establishment on the East Coast. Eh? Don\u2019t like the sound of that? Prison planet it is then. Yeah, thought that\u2019d make you change your mind. Next shuttle leaves in ten hours. You\u2019d better be on it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon\u2019t know much about History? Biology? A science book? Then you\u2019ll fit right in to Alien House. It\u2019s the coolest, hippest, happeningest frat house on campus, but watch out! Dean 'Wormhole' is on the warpath. He\u2019s been trying to have Alien House closed down for years, and now he thinks he\u2019s got them just where he wants them. Complete your studies, have a cracking time and save Alien House from closure. Do you think you can manage that? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSci-Fi Beta Kappa is a game where players take on the role of slacker aliens with a bunch of abilities such as power manipulation, enhanced senses, larceny, super strength etc., who, having been kicked off their homeworlds for various misdemeanors, have been exiled to Terra. There, they get into all sorts of scrapes and are under constant surveillance by Dean 'Wormhole', who hates aliens and is always looking for an excuse to close down Alien House.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThink Animal House meets Men in Black, with a dash of Monsters And Other Childish Things. Anyone interested in playtesting this game, please either reply in this thread, PM me here or on UKRP (userID catty_big) or e-mail leomarshalldesigns [at] hotmail [dot] com. If you're outside the UK I'll e-mail you the rules and an opening scenario. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nParty on dudes (just don't get caught!).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359646/#Comment_359646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T16:01:38+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  4:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following a recent query, here's some more info about the mechanics:<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Trad/indie spectrum it's somewhere in the middle, i.e. GMful, not diceless but big on narrative and player interaction. The closest comparison would probably be Umlaut, where you undertake a series of challenges, success being narrated by the player and failure narrated by the GM/facilitator. Success at skill checks means that players build up a store of dice to roll in the epilogue, while failure means that the GM builds up a store of damage dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe're looking at a d12 dice pool, no. of dice equivalent to attribute + skill (e.g. physical + larceny). Scene by scene, failure will be narrated according to the action, e.g. if the alien with the larceny skill is being employed, they will be able to steal/break in etc., but will perhaps leave evidence behind. At the epilogue, the GM will narrate the denouement, which will be on a sliding scale of Alien House closed down completely, saved but under Double Secret probation/final warning etc., all the way up to Alien House saved, zero recrimination, gets to take part in the parade, in fact gets to be at the head of the parade. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntro scenario: Toga! Toga! Toga! The Dean has just given AH a massive dressing down and spirits are low. What better way to lift them than with a toga party? After all, what could possibly go wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy to answer any queries :D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360880/#Comment_360880" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T14:53:14+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  2:53PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2012 2:53PM by catty_big.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nearly ready!

I must say, it felt a bit weird playing in a game that I'm one of the designers of. I expect it was similarly weird for Dan, my co-writer, too, but he really stepped up with both his GMing and his portrayal of Kraag, who in no way resembles a member of a fictional warrior race conceived by Gene Roddenbury.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHats off to the other players, Bill and Nick, who got stuck in and expanded the pre-gens with their RPing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHighlight? Well, I think it has to be Kraag at the toga party, trying to impress his idol, Princess N'Zala, by brandishing a vibrator that my character, Drunzi, had stolen from a sex shop and suggesting she put it somewhere Not Safe for Work. Yeah, I think y'all know what I mean. Anyway, he rolled the dice and got six demerits, which meant that the haughty N'Zala, the most popular Zarkonian on campus, was distinctly unimpressed by this. First she knocks the hapless Kraag to the ground and then, beckoning her entourage, storms out of Alien House, batting away Harok's offer of one of his 'special cakes' as she goes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHonourable memtion too for Zlith for releasing the energy he's been storing up through his power manipulation ability to make his head glow on and off and act as a kind of disco light. Epic!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan't wait for my next game!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nP.S. Apologies folks for taking so long to get SFBK in front of the general role-playing public- I hope to put up a PDF somewhere soon so folks can download that at least while we wait for the book to come out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368196/#Comment_368196" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T20:53:59+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  8:53PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds very cool.

For tonight\u2019s game, as it was with people from my club, I decided to experiment with totally sandboxing it- no Epilogue, no dice-rolling, just roleplaying. Two of the players asked to roll up their own characters, which I had misgivings about as I knew that breaking new ground in that way would be a serious stress test for the game. But then I thought Yeah, go on, let\u2019s try it and see what happens. <br/><br/>One guy played an Or\u2019od (the teleporter) but decided that he had taken the shape of the first elegant-looking lifeform he came across when arriving on Terra, which turned out to be an aspidistra. He reckoned that if you pick a lifeform to begin with you can then teleport into other examples of that lifeform, so he spent most of the game jumping in and out of cacti, rhododendrons and spider plants etc. This 'botaniportation' worked a treat, the highlight for me being a food fight he managed to cause in the staff room, by reaching slyly with his tendrils (that was when he was in a spider plant), hoicking sugar lumps and coffee cups and chucking them around. Then, finally, he whacked the Dean (who had entered the staff room to investigate) on the back of the head with a well-aimed sugar cube as he teleported away from the scene. Oh and just before that, when he was in a rhododendron bush outside the staff room, the Dean\u2019s dog (which was being walked by a college servant) urinated on him. <br/><br/>We had a character who had been sent to Terra by mistake, as he was being transported to the lunatic colony on Planet Bedlam. He thought he was Harkness Tennesse Mayflower Buttercup Phillips, Viscount of Lincolnshire (don\u2019t worry Nick, half the House of Lords are similarly deluded), whose core quality was puppetry, which he employed to good effect on various college officials, although on one occasion he used it to try to bags himself better accommodation, but rolled a high number of demerits ( which is what we call the fallout from a bad dice roll), and ended up rooming with an equally potty Terran who thinks he's a Roman Emperor. Hang on, Roman Emperor eh? Can we use him in the toga party? [Thinks......]<br/><br/>Finally, Dan, my co-writer, played a Zarkonian, but not the Zarkonian pre-gen, Kraag, who, along with all the other pre-gens is now an NPC. He is playing Grahh, a character that, like Kraag, is a super strength guy. Now Kraag is always trying to hook up with Princess N\u2019Zala, the coolest Zarkonian female on campus, so Grahh thought he\u2019d try to impress her himself with his heavy lifting ability. Unfortunately he rolled four demerits, which I added to the four from a previous scene that I\u2019d been wondering what to do with. Well of course, I couldn\u2019t resist. I had him lifting dumbbells in the canteen, in front of loads of other students, including Princess N\u2019Zala and Kraag, who just happened to be sitting nearby. N\u2019Zala was unimpressed by this display and turned to Kraag- who had been trying it on without success practically since he\u2019d arrived on campus- and said sweetly \u2018You\u2019re the only guy for me Kraag; come to my room later.\u2019 Now to put you in the picture, just imagine how Worf from Star Trek, or G\u2019Kaar from Babylon 5 would have taken that kind of humiliation. Exactly! So the stage is now set for a no doubt bitter rivalry between the two. <br/> <br/>It was an absolutely cracking game, and all my fears about player-genned characters proved totally unfounded, in fact they made the game even more hilariously awesome, if that's possible. And I think having the new PCs meet the existing ones (who are now, as I said, NPCs) worked very well indeed, especially in the first scene as they acted as foils for the new characters. <br/><br/>So, all in all, absolutely phenomenal sauce! I can't wait to see what kind of mischief the PCs get up to next week. But they should be warned: I'm going to start doing skill checks (and totting up the demerits) next time so they need to watch their step, and try not to get Alien House closed down.<br/><br/>Link to current draft: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44973653/SFBKL.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44973653/SFBKL.pdf</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386261/#Comment_386261" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T17:21:08+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  5:21PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2012 5:21PM by catty_big.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=13439" rel="nofollow">Full three week report</a> now up.
