It's been 7 or 8 years since the last time that I played 3.5 D&amp;D, and from all I heard from my pals and catched from the game at first glance, it looked really good. But then almost every bad experience I had with 3.5 hent through my head again as I got deeper and deeper into the game. <br/><br/>So I beg your pardon but I have to rant it out of me. Most of this things are about my feelings, that's why most of it is gonna be quite unreasonable. However, there's a chance that you might find something useful, something that also happen to you or something ridiculous enough to make you laugh. Be my guest.<br/><br/>-Why do I have to roll 3d6 for stats (or use any other of the methods in the book) if all I care for are the modifiers? Those numbers just fill space in the character sheet and never get used again in the game, at least as far as the general rules on the corebook go... I mean, ok, create your characters like that, but then just write down the modifiers on your sheet and you're done! (oh yeah, I could have done this withour exclamation signs, but it's a rant, exclamations are important)<br/><br/>-I rolled crappy stats. Ok, next time I'll go for purchasing points, my bad. But then again there shouldn't be crappy rolls. There should be rolls that create something interesting to play, that give you different choices instead of just taking away most choices from you. <br/><br/>-Anyway I wanted to play a monk. Yes it was the worst choice, though it's improved from the D&amp;D version. And it's still a poor class choice. I mean, why does the BAB progression has to be so poor? What kind of thing is meant to be simulated by that? Dude, I've been doing some martial training myself and though PCs are suppossed to be fantasy characters and I'm no Bruce Lee, I feel like I can do more things than my character.<br/><br/>-I definitely didn't get what I had in mind. I looked at the cool portrait of the monk featured in the book and then at my character sheet and got the same feeling you have when you compare the huge public add of a beautiful and healthy hamburger against the crappy and full of grease little synthetic sandwich they serve you. I even went and wrote "Shoemaker" as a craft skill, since I couldn't see this PC making the cut as an adventurer.<br/><br/>-I hate losing a turn (or more), rolling consecutive 1's, being otherwise incapacitated and have stats and resources taken away from my character, specially when none of this things generate other situation than taking away my resources as a player to interact with the game. Took me three days to make a character (mostly because I had many interruptions, had to re-learn the game, cared about reading carefully the rules, double check the sources of every single bonus the rules gave to this particular PC and checked the equipment weight and price) so losing resources because of bad luck and having to wait for good rolls to make an input to the fiction feels like those three days were an awful waste of time.<br/><br/>Ok, the rest of the things I could rant about are less reasonable than this and have less to do with the game. Now, how nuts do you think I am? Or am I making any sense at all?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375106/#Comment_375106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T10:05:25+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 10:05AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of this sounds like you aren't very good at the game (yet).

Death To Ability Scores.<br/><br/>The rest of your rant is that the monk is not a good class, and that is certainly true, and that 1st level characters in D&amp;D3 <i>et. seq.</i> miss a lot, and that is also certainly true.<br/><br/>Although I still am puzzled how it can take 3 days to make a monk character in Pathfinder, especially when you are starting at 1st level.  When you said you had to read the rules, are you including stuff like reading every feat trying to find the right one or reading spell lists to see what you'll be facing, or...?<br/><br/>Here, I'll make a monk with the Pathfinder SRD, let's time it:<br/><br/>Monk McPunchface, level 1 human monk<br/>STR +4, DEX 0, CON +1, INT -1, WIS -1, CHA 0 (I spared you the ability scores themselves)<br/>BAB 0, Ranged: +0, Melee: +4 (1d6+4 unarmed), Initiative +4<br/>AC 10<br/>HP: 9<br/>Feats/Class Abilities:<br/>Flurry of Blows: -1/-1<br/>Stunning Fist: 1/day<br/>Hero's Fortune (starting feat, so if I roll a bunch of 1s like you did, I can reroll it)<br/>Improved Initiative (human bonus feat)<br/>Deflect Arrows (monk bonus feat)<br/><br/>Skills:<br/>Acrobatics +3<br/>Craft (Shoemaking, gotta have good shoes) +2<br/>Perception +3<br/><br/>Done in 15 minutes.  Maybe I grab a spear or something? But whatever, 1d6+4 damage is pretty good damage at first level.<br/><br/>Now, I didn't (obviously) calculate out exactly how to wring the very most bonuses out of the system to make this guy super-amazingly great.  But it doesn't sound like you had fun doing that either, so I didn't do it here. I just picked some stuff that didn't have prerequisites or that had simple prerequisites and sounded fun.<br/><br/>For some groups, failing to squeeze every single +1 out of your character is a failure of character design. If that's the case, and you don't care about it that much (I never do), then the group's a mismatch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375115/#Comment_375115" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T10:28:40+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 10:28AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm  familiar with your issues and have many more of my own with D&amp;D3.5 and 4,.0.  The first two issues is what made me move to True20, but it really did not fix your other issues.  I did find with True20 by having three classes that you build up by choosing feats got me closer to what I envisioned, but it was never exact.  <br/><br/>Today if I wanted the D&amp;D feel it would be Dungeon world, and if I wanted a high fantasy game I would choose a different game depending on what my players are looking for between:  High Valor, Burning Wheel, Legends of Anglerre(Fate), Solar System(TSoY) or Hero Quest. I feel the only reason to play D&amp;D is the name recognition or you have players that have spent a lot of time mastering the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375134/#Comment_375134" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T11:10:03+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 11:10AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I need to get more characters killed and practice creating characters faster... and then again it looks like probably I'll need a few more weeks of trainig before I could break JD record.<br/><br/>Strange, I didn't found improved initiative or Hero's fortune in the corebook we're using, I could have go for that. After spending a couple of hours on saturday morning and another few on sunday comparing what kind of things could be more useful I settled for skill focus: acrobatics, improved grapple from the monk list and defensive combat training, since I thought CMB was used instead of AC. GM only cleared that part for me when we were about to start the game so I kept it. Deflect Arrows would have been a waste in the session, because we got attacked by kobolds who fired through concealed slits in the walls of the dungeon. The heavy mace of the fighter and my crowbar were more useful for tearing away the walls to catch the kobolds.<br/><br/>How come I only got 5 skill points and you've got 8? In Pathfinder monks get int+4 (wich for me was...4) add 1 skill point for Human and I chose to use the favored class free point in HP instead of skills, which left me with 5 skill points. This info is kind of spreaded in the book, but is all there. And then there were the weapons and I was like Come on! I couldn't even afford a couple of shortswords so I settled for a couple of daggers, the sling, shurikens and why bother about the rest...<br/><br/>Well in other occasions I went for whatever I could get out of the GM in 30 min or less but this time I had the book and spare time so I decided to delve deeper into it and see what I've been missing.<br/><br/>Seth, you're right. I'm totally stealing your list and seeing if the GM gets interested in any of those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375136/#Comment_375136" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T11:14:10+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 11:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well first things first -- I don't think you're nuts <i>at all</i>.   These seems like totally valid preferences.  I've never played Pathfinder, but I have done some D&amp;D 3.0 some years ago.  In general, I'm not partial to the genre of D&amp;D in the first place, regardless of the system used.  <br/><br/>Still, let's be clear that they are preferences rather than objective problems.  Also, they seem somewhat specific as opposed to general issues with traditional systems.  It seems to me that distilled down, your two main issues are: <br/><br/>1) Starting characters are less competent and cool than you would like in Pathfinder.  There are plenty of traditional games where you can be a cool heroic or superheroic character from the start.  On the other hand, I liked HarnMaster where we had randomly rolled characters who were full of flaws and issues, and characters were sometimes beer-brewing townsfolk dragged into action bigger than them.  <br/><br/>2) The Pathfinder system was too complicated for your taste.  That seems completely valid, but conversely I happily played games like Champions and Star Fleet Battles for years.  <br/><br/>I don't think anyone likes <i>all</i> traditional RPG systems.  It's good to know your tastes and play something you like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375142/#Comment_375142" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T11:42:49+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 11:42AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I realize this is just a personal rant.

So with the Monk, you take the middle road in terms of HP and BAB, but your CMB (ability to do cool stuff like grapple, disarm, trip, and sunder) is every bit the equal of the aforementioned fighty guy. Plus, you get a bunch of unique movement and defensive bonus abilities that he'll never get, and your saves are as good as a dragon's of your hit dice.

I'm with you. <br/><br/>I loved D&amp;D2E and Rifts (FSM help me), and I played them for a long time, but... D&amp;D3E, 3.5, 4E, Pathfinder... I can't make heads or tails of these games. There's just too much to learn in order to run a session. And I've gotten to the point where I just don't have the patience for low ability-score rolls, whiff factor, bad rolls, failed saving throws... Yeah.

It was what me and my group played 90% of the time until 3.5 came out. Then we played that. And now we've been playing Pathfinder for two years or so. So you can imagine I've played <i>a lot</i> of these games in the past 10 years (I was the DM most of the time). Initially we had a load of fun, but then due to various factors I became increasingly dissatisfied with the game, by the end of 3.5's run I basically hated it. Then, one day something just clicked and I was like "Oh, <i>that's</i> how you play this game!". I still think it's a mess, but I'm having quite a lot of fun with it. I ran a brief campaign recently (about 6 sessions) and I've been a player in another that has been going on for over a year when we can get together (we're level 9).<br/><br/>I'll just trow some stuff out there and hopefully you'll find some of it useful.<br/><br/>1. First off, 3.x/PF has a lot of junk like confirming criticals, lots of derived stats, and attacks of opportunity. You just got to bite down on that sour apple. Some of it is just completely boring, pointless shit that (IMO) makes the game run poorer, some of it is a barrier of clunkiness that you need to climb over to get to the fun (kinda like the subsystems in BW, right). Most groups learn to simply avoid or houserule the really boring stuff which means "it's not a problem" because it doesn't even come up in play.<br/><br/>2. Related to the above, the game requires at least a degree of system mastery, or rather system exploration. It's one of the main draws of the game really. If you can't get into that, the best thing you can do and still have fun is: get a coach. Someone who knows how to build a character in five minutes and knows the rules inside out. There's usually at least one at every table. Ask him or her to help you out! Preferably this shouldn't be the DM, because they have their hands full already. As they help you, one thing that often happens is they start playing for you, using your character as an extra pawn and you just sit there. Instead, learn from what they show you, ask questions (like: "Why is this a better choice?") and take matters back into your own hands. The bulk of rules is enormous but you don't really need all that to have fun, but a minimal investment is required.<br/><br/>3. Embrace the chaos! A lot of what comes out of D&amp;D is because of the swinginess of that damn d20. Learn to stop worrying and love the randomness. It stings in the moment, but don't take it personally, but rather observe how it changes the emerging situation and tactical landscape. It <i>always</i> sucks to roll poorly, but don't think "I rolled poorly, my character failed." but rather "Something bad happened, how can we fix it.". It's all about the challenges. (D&amp;D, by the book is terrible for character-oriented, gratifying, right-to-dreamist play...this is why "we didn't roll the dice even once!" became a proud rallying cry in some circles).<br/><br/>4. Fight the chaos! JD said the difference between 5 and 8 isn't a lot. I respectfully disagree. You have to squeeze every point you can get. Ok, take this with a grain of salt. If <i>all</i> you do it scrounge for +1s that's just boring, but the system mastery mentioned above is so you can turn your +4 into a +6 at the right moment and change your miss into a hit. It's because the d20 is so swingy that every bonus matters - minimize the risk, turn the odds in your favor. You can't avoid rolling ones, but you can make it so you only need a 10 to hit instead of a 15. That's quite a difference. Going for every little bonus imo makes the game dull, but there's a lot of satisfaction of pulling a good combo and turning the tables.<br/><br/>5. 1st level characters are relatively incompetent (even if PF gives them a bunch more stuff than 3e). There's a reason why most games I remember started at level 3. This is partially because of how the fucking feat chains are set up in 3.x which mean that you need god knows how many levels to learn something any peasant should be able to do. Ignore that! There's other stuff you can do that no one else can do. You got to soldier on through that first stretch. There are little bumps in character power every now and then. At level 3 your character will be accomplished. At level 7 they will be badass. Monks -although they changed considerably in PF- also aren't the greatest class ever, but your strength should lie in grappling and pushing and stuff like that. Maybe you could try a different class, see if you have more fun with that? Ask your DM if you can rebuild.<br/><br/>6. Regarding building characters I can see how you would be frustrated if you spent three days on something that doesn't really perform all that well. When you build your character, use a blank sheet of paper to quickly organize your info then transfer/add up all that on the character sheet. I think 3.x character sheets are terrible. I usually use hand-written ones or I type them up in word (here's my most recent <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/24592325/Erion.pdf" rel="nofollow">character</a>). Quickly pick a combo of class and race that goes well together. Write down everything your first level gives you. Pick your feat or two (or three if you're a human fighter), distribute skills, tally everything up.<br/><br/>7. See if <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a> helps you. It's a searchable online Pathfinder SRD, it's basically the only thing me and my group use to play.<br/><br/>8. Shoemaker skill? So because you don't feel your character is a competent adventurer you're making him even more incompetent? Yes yes, I know, it's easy to hate the game, I hate it too. But that's poor form, and basically a passive aggressive rebellion against the game. I don't care about what anyone says how awesome it is that Profession or Craft skills are in the game. Screw that stuff. Put your skill points into something that makes you a better adventurer. Don't kneel before the game, the game is a bully. Punch it in the gut and take it's stuff. If you don't feel you're doing anything there's generally two or three things going on: (a) you picked a crap class, (b) you need to gain a couple of levels more, (c) you're not using your strong points. It's often hard to say which ones are which. Maybe change your monk for something else or rather try to stick with him for a couple of levels more (you get another feat at second, which is more than most people can say, at third you become great at CMB and move faster and at fourth you get Ki). At fifth level you can jump ~50 feet from a spot, then punch/kick, trip or disarm up to three people (or punch/kick someone three times) as you land.<br/><br/>9. A huge part of D&amp;D gameplay is resource management. You need to do the best you can with what you've got. Actions are a resource - if you lose or waste your standard action you've still got your move and swift - make the best of them. People often forget that they have a 5ft step available. If the game gives you skill points, invest them in something that will make you better at kicking ass.<br/><br/>10. Taking a few steps back. The game is, as part of the legacy of 3E, full of trap choices. Sadly. It's one of my biggest gripes with it. This is why getting a coach might be a good idea. Like, there's literally one feat and one weapon choice of difference between an otherwise identical character where the first one deals ~20 damage per turn and the other deals ~60. I know optimization is dull and boring, but that's how the game is set up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
