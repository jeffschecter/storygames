I mean, the 30 levels of 4E are basically a remapping of the power curve of levels 1-10 in 3.5, if you cut the 3.5 rogue and core spellcasters out of the equation. So, level 12 means basically stopping at 3.5's level 4. <br/><br/>4E is incredibly less gonzo-epic than 3.5 was. What's your motivation to cut down the power curve even more?

Above 9th level or so, characters had too many options and the game got too complex for the DM to prep easily. Below 4th level or so, characters felt too fragile and they didn't have enough options to make them interesting. Somewhere around level 6 was the game's "sweet spot." This is acknowledged by the 4e team in their design blogs.<br/><br/>I get the impression that 4e makes an E6 unnecessary. The whole game, from level 1 to 30, is in the sweet spot. <br/><br/>But, if you want a fundamentally different kind of play than 4e provides, house rule it and have fun.

Then the paragon path stuff happens. However, it *does* give a hard limit that you can dabble in a second class, but not a third. So your statement about the four-class build is still correct. <br/><br/>Personally, I'm fond of the new approach.

So, ditch any class, and just give your PC any powers you want in accordance with the level progression table. Poof! Point-buy D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I was just having this exact conversation with myself tonight as I rolled up my first new D&amp;D character in about 10 years. (Triin Galfour, 5th level infernal warlock)  I looked into multiclassing and I was actually a bit shocked to see how limited it is in the canon - 1st level at-wills only, which without the class features tend to be pretty weak.  I wanted to make a sort of point-blank warlock/rogue who was all stabby and had things like Dire Radiance and life-steals that made his melee presence unbearable.  Adding in the stabbiness meant two feats out of four (the weapon proficiency for daggers and the multiclass feat), and even then I could only use the stabby power once in an encounter.  Pointless.<br/><br/>So I started comparing across classes, and I came to the same conclusion: While I'm sure there's some totally rad munchkin combos out there, powers are a) pretty low-key until you get into the Paragon levels (and even then, the power curve's pretty smooth), and b) while the flavor is different, the mechanics pretty much stay equivalent between powers of the same level and usage.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think I'm going to do some testing and probably ditch power restrictions, with the obvious advantage of having powers in your class interacting with your class feature.<br/><br/>[Edit: I'm also unsure why they kept skills at all, since the list is so incredibly short and they don't interact with powers.  It'd be more mechanically smooth to roll them into some sort of free attribute-based feat or power.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147906/#Comment_147906" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T02:24:27+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  2:24AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 2:28AM by John K.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>[Edit: I'm also unsure why they kept skills at all, since the list is so incredibly short and they don't interact with powers.

Skills and Rituals basically define your character outside of combat and while D&amp;D is fighting focused it's not exclusivly combat.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
