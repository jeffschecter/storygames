It is like have the Chimera move from the get go (hybrid forms) plus I don't expect people to take on full beast form. Now you can just shift gills, claws and a tail then go wild.<br/><br/>The <b>Magus</b> is my attempt at doing a more generic version of The Mage but his Cast a Spell move broken down into defined pieces that are (unfortunately) less narrative. The problem here is that I don't have enough space on the playbook template to fit everything. Also, I don't know if the moves I made are stupid boring. But I do know that the class won't be as wide open as the mage but less defined than the wizard. It isn't done because I reached a point where I wasn't sure if what I was doing would work...<br/><br/>You can take a look at the small changes I made to the <b>Fighter</b>. I basically tweaked his signature weapon to be cooler and have more enhancements available. Plus, a few new advanced moves. Nothing major.<br/><br/>The <b>Reaper</b> and <b>Vampire</b> are compendium classes that I altered from other folks' work for my personal use. You can make fun of those if you want, too.<br/><br/>Anyways, huge thanks goes out to anyone that can supply me with feedback. The G+ DW community doesn't give me a whole lot of attention so I'm growing desperate.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427439/#Comment_427439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-19T12:53:38+00:00" title="January 19, 2014 12:53PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey mate, cool ideas!

Supernatural stuff tends to need clear/understandable limits. They also usually need specific fictional elements, though. These moves feel like an entirely procedural ruleset. Even the Mage has a bunch of foci or whatever that start you off with something concrete to envision. Especially Utility Magic, which is like saying "eh, you know, you can do a bunch of, like, magic stuff." If I have to make everything up anyway, why do I need a new class? This is maybe why people say they're not fiction first enough. Have you seen Jacob Randolph's new Mage series (dragon mage, winter mage, clock mage)? Those are exciting because they're based on specifics, and you play them for the stuff you probably wouldn't have thought of on your own, which is inspiring. (Also, have you posted at the Something Awful DW thread? Only some of them are active on the g+ DW group).<br/><br/>Also, some of this stuff seems a bit fiddly? Like, ask yourself what you gain by writing out all of Grey Magic as opposed to just: When you defend with your magic, add INT to your roll instead of CON. Or, why roll to see how many times you can mimic a monster move? Right now, the player has to roll even if they don't ever intend to mimic it. You could set it to a stat modifier's amount, or just twice, with an advanced move that gives you three times instead (or four even). Or allow the player to choose to "forget" it on a 7-9, just like a normal spell. All of those options would be quicker and probably give the player more confidence in that power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427485/#Comment_427485" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-20T21:36:04+00:00" title="January 20, 2014  9:36PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have seen those, actually. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I intend on buying the bundle when he finishes it!

For anything, actually! I only troll rpg.net, s-g and the tavern. Maybe I'll give it a shot.<br/><br/>But yeah. What you say makes sense. But at the same time, I really like the way the different colors operate on a mechanical level (with the exception of blue, more on that below). I need to figure out a way to keep those moves but make them work for DW. Somehow...<br/><br/>How about...<br/>When an effect from a magic move is used for the first time, the player must write a short phrase describing the spell's impact on the fiction. From henceforth, that effect may only be used within the description's fictional restrictions.<br/>Does that work at all...? Or should I just start writing up custom mages a la Jacob Randolph style?<br/><br/>As for gray magic... Since I'm making it a starting move I wanted it to be better than simply <i>use INT</i>. I know that is actually really good but I wanted <i>more</i>. Hold is slightly better. There is no stipulation that you need to be near the target to defend them. In fact, you can defend everyone with gray magic as long as you have the hold, it isn't limited to a specific target. The damage option ignores armor. (I don't like the way the damage scales with level for the original move and thus don't do that in my games) I think it is worth it the extra text, personally.<br/><br/>You are right on the money with blue magic. I had misgivings regarding it the entire time... this is the feedback that I was hoping for.<br/><br/>How about this?<br/><br/>When you <b>absorb a monster\u2019s special power</b>, you may add that power to your blue magic list, or replace a power if you are at your maximum. You may hold up to two monster powers.<br/><br/>When you <b>attempt to mimic a monster power</b>, roll +INT. *On a 10+, you mimic it perfectly achieving the full effects. *On a 7-9, you mimic the power but something happens, choose one\u2026<br/>* The mimicry is only half as effective<br/>* You draw unwanted attention or put someone in a spot<br/>* The mimicry saps your energy. Take -1 ongoing to INT until you have had time to clear your head<br/><br/>Sapphire Apprentice<br/>You may hold up to three monster powers at a time.<br/>When you mimic a monster power and roll 6-, you may choose to forget that power in order to treat the roll as a 10+.<br/><br/>Sapphire Master<br/>You may hold up to four monster powers at a time.<br/>When you mimic a monster power and roll 12+, you may choose to enhance the power in some way as discussed between you and the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427491/#Comment_427491" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T01:06:16+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  1:06AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generic isn't always bad. Those moves just seem a bit like they are basic moves for a wizard-centric game, where each character is magic and they are differentiated by what kind of magic they can do. So, like one character is all about the Night and Romance and the Stars, so she can defend with a cloud of stardust, cover herself with a cloak of night, and inspire passionate feelings in people (or whatever other stuff she can shoehorn into those three concepts). And another character is all Fire and Ice and Battle. No cloak of shadows for that dude! The same as when you try to hack and slash, it matters whether you are using a two-handed battle axe or a knife, right? Sure, the results could be "deal your damage" and nothing more, but then why play DW? Likewise, the Frost Witch fighting a White Dragon shouldn't be able to just switch to fireballs. The player should have to be a little more creative and find something within their wheelhouse.<br/><br/>So yeah, letting players choose that during play is fine. You might end up limiting them too much with a phrase they have to always use afterward, though. Probably a collection of motifs, concepts, or elements would work best. And if you want the player to be able to change things up over the course of the game, you could model that after the blue magic format in your last post.<br/><br/>Grey Magic:<br/>Okay, so you've got a list of differences, now you need to beat on the move until you find the best way to do each one. It sounds like part of the trigger should be setting up a defensive spell, since you want to be able to spend that hold to defend anyone in range of your magic. I would say go with a die roll for damage though. It may be worth making two base damages for your class -- one for weapons, another for magic.<br/><br/>Blue Magic:<br/>I feel like I've read a previous discussion of this kind of blue magic somewhere before, and maybe even commented on it, but I can't remember right now. Maybe it was your stuff on g+? Someone else's? Blue magic is a popular idea. I dunno. Some thoughts (and some variations to consider):<br/>1. I'd maybe go with three slots to start with? I'd at least playtest it with three, although that might be more appropriate for a mage that starts with ONLY blue magic and not two styles.<br/>2. Mimicking moves that get used against you is also quite a limit--you have to get pummelled a bunch before you can do any yourself. Might be better to mimick monster moves you have witnessed or have been used in your presence.<br/>3. "Half as effective" often tends to mean "doesn't work at all." It's okay for stuff like damage, but I think it's better to go the opposite direction, especially with magic, and have the spell work plus unwanted side-effects. Like you end up casting two spells and the GM picks the other one.<br/><br/>Also: I don't really like Arcane Learning. The GM is already giving you something useful and interesting on a 10+. If you want the class to get more info on magic stuffs, something like Bardic Lore might work better -- you see a magic item, you ask a question. Or you see magic in use you ask a question. etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427500/#Comment_427500" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T07:47:04+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  7:47AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you very much for taking the time to help me out, good sir. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Hm. It sounds like you want me to move towards something a little more concrete like the mage's foci. Which makes sense, of course. What if each magus had to select a Verb, Noun and... ... ... something... to describe his magic? (I was tempted to say Season for the last word, going Ryuutama style then associate each with an element)<br/><br/>Yeah, I had thought about changing the damage from a straight 3 to 1d6. Black magic deals 1d8. Then everything else is 1d4.<br/>Are you saying I should define the trigger better? Right now it is simply, "When you cast a spell that protects." If you roll a hit, you get to spend the hold as long as you focus on the spell (which differs from defend where you have to stand in defense of your target).<br/><br/>As for blue magic, yeah, I remember that discussion. You didn't like the 'experience the power first hand' stipulation back then either. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It wasn't me that started it but I certainly watched with interest as I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan.<br/>The source material requires that the power hit the mage before he can learn the spell, which is why that is the default assumption. That said, trying to make a move that mirrors a video game too closely is bound to fail, I'm sure.<br/>I don't have any issue with bumping the initial slots up by 1.<br/>Witnessing a power truly changes the way blue magic works. You go from absorbing offense only powers to being able to gain access to utility and defensive powers. I hadn't thought about it in this way. It certainly merits a playtest.<br/>What if I change it from 'Half as effective' to 'Half as effective or unwanted effects, GM's choice.'?<br/><br/>Arcane Learning was lifted directly from The Mage. I'm not a big fan of it either but I did want a knowledge type move for the magus to start with. I'll look into modifying bardic lore for the magus. (that would make it the 2nd move I stole from the bard!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427513/#Comment_427513" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T13:29:33+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  1:29PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2014 2:11PM by Johnstone.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absorbing only is probably fine if the class has some other starting moves. The witness-mimic mage should probably have that as their main deal. Keep in mind that I don't play video games at all and know absolutely nothing about Final Fantasy, so all I have to go on is thinking what I'd want to do while playing at the table. And I'm just throwing out ideas here, you still gotta make 'em work.<br/><br/>Verb and noun reminds me of Ars Magica. Seasons sounds like kind of a cool idea, actually. You'll probably have to sit around thinking up different types of mages until you figure out a system that works for you. But even if you just have a few words for inspiration, like they are there to give the player a loose idea of what their magic is like, is a good idea.<br/><br/>Go ahead and steal from the Bard! Who cares? Nobody's gonna sue you.<br/><br/>Oh, edit: Cast a protective spell probably works fine, actually, although you want to make sure there is room there for the actual intent of the spell to succeed. Like, if you cast Protection from Cold so the party can travel through the ice storm, the real point is that they don't freeze and neither does their equipment. Which could be modeled with damage reduction, or with you spending hold to "overcome an obstacle" or something similar. So you cast Protection from Traps on the Fighter so she can run into the throne room and seize the golden idol and it doesn't turn into "okay, you take 7 damage from the poison darts, oh you spend a hold to reduce that to 3?" and more like "okay, there's molten lava, poison snakes, and an evil curse before you grab the idol. Oh, that's your three hold?

Do you think red magic is okay?<br/>I don't like the way the original summon monsters spell works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427567/#Comment_427567" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T14:08:27+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  2:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like grey and red, playtest them as-is, and adjust if you have any problems. When it's you playing the game, the wording doesn't matter quite as much as when the class gets played when you're not around. I suspect you might have better luck getting someone else to play it if you post it on the Something Awful thread than on G+, but you never know. Summon Monster is a spell, so turning it into a move should at least make it less random, which you did, and maybe a bit better, depending on level. It's a pretty good option for a Charisma 8 Magus. I think "task" sounds more concrete than "major action" but that might also make the eidolon more useful than you want them to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
