So, on this episode, Jeff, Jason, Joe and I play the Burning Wheel derived game, Mouse Guard, based on the comic series by Dave Peterson. It all kicks off with us totally bullying Jeff into opening his MINT IN BOX Mouse Guard Box Set... that was fun.. and pics will follow...<br/><br/>The scenario is one of those included in the Set and called FIND THE GRAIN PEDDLER. It follows a comic story but we make it our own... with truly awful dice rolls.<br/><br/><a href="http://media.podcastingmanager.com/2/0/6/6/8/295141-286602/Media/rsg051_Mouse%20Guard.mp3" rel="nofollow">Download Here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
