This is big for me, as it often takes me some time to "wind up" when getting into a character. But whether a cynic, a romantic, a man or woman, Shane really gets into his characters. That's probably why he is so into Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Everyone at my table brings something to it (Quintin Stone = great with planning, keeping characters involved, Travis Bryant = great at character acting, etc).

It's one of the reasons why I rarely worry about putting the player's characters in a tough spot when I run games; he can be relied upon to come up with some pretty ridiculous (if nearly plausible) ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257874/#Comment_257874" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T10:10:35+00:00" title="February 23, 2010 10:10AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two guys I've played with, who you have never heard of:<br/><br/><a href="http://samablog.robsama.com/" rel="nofollow">Rob Sama</a> always manages to come up with memorable, off-the-beaten path character concepts and breathe life into them in spectacular fashion. The sundress wearing wookie (who spent a lot of time discussing "the lifestyle" on-line with the handful of other transvestite wookies in the galaxy), Le Chef Magique (the arrogant awakened television chef who was forced into a life of shadowrunning after he punched a kid on his live Christmas Special), MacBride (who gave up a life of swashbuckling piracy to go to university and agitate for Democracy), you could always count on Rob to bring his own style to any game you played. (This description would help if you could hear him singing the Chef Magique theme song in French.)<br/><br/><a href="http://sturmdrang.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Jeff Herrold</a> is the best long-term campaign GM I've ever seen. One reason why is a supernatural willingness to ditch his own notions in favor of those of the player's. Example: at the end of the best campaign I've ever been in, he asked if we had questions. I remembered a point years earlier where the group had a choice between following two goals that led in opposite directions, and asked what would have happened if we had made the other choice. "One sec", he said, and left the room. He came back with two huge binders and showed us what the plan would have been in that case. What impressed me wasn't so much that he had done all that planning, but that he totally jettisoned it all without us even noticing, basically because we zigged instead of zagged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257881/#Comment_257881" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T10:54:09+00:00" title="February 23, 2010 10:54AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My little brother is amazingly good at being a co-GM.
