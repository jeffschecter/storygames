The instructions and conflict driving mechanisms are mostly rolled into the Prompts cards.<br/><br/>Really I wanted to see if I could create a generic story game with minimalist rules. It's not designed for replayability, I will publish it for free if I do publish it. It would be straightforward to add play sets (generic or not) in the future.<br/><br/>The biggest problems in play testing were problems of pacing: groups spent too much time on world creation and the first half of the deck.

The players are engaging in a communal storytelling exercise in a conch-passing fashion. You always pass turn clockwise. On your turn you must, in addition to doing general chairmanning and maintenance of the story, draw a prompt card and follow its instructions. The prompt cards are numbered in order, and together they essentially act as a mad-libs frame into which the players slot their own detail. The cards chart the process of story creation top-down, from setting to character to sequential plot run-through, such that once the players have exhausted the deck, the story will be finished.</i><br/><br/>Assuming I understood this correctly, a follow-up question: what kind of creative motivations do you envision a group to have when they play this? Is it just that the players want to create a story together? What kind of people are they - particularly, do you envision players who like creating stories and do it outside of gaming exercises, or are the players people who need the structure a game provides to support them in story creation?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" rel="nofollow">Mongrel_GM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The biggest problems in play testing were problems of pacing: groups spent too much time on world creation and the first half of the deck.

I would expect that this would inject some needed alacrity into the proceedings. Note that the players would presumably feel responsible for finishing their turns successfully, because playing an incomplete or bad turn accrues problems for the next player in line, and the group as a whole, so you'd be letting down the team by failing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466516/#Comment_466516" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T14:47:45+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  2:47PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2017 2:48PM by Mongrel_GM.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, thanks for your thoughts.<br/><br/>Your summary is accurate, with the departure from "pass the conch" that play test groups usually chose to frame a lot of scenes, and that contributed to running out of time.<br/><br/>One of the MDA aesthetics of the game is expression in the form of barely bounded creative options, which I attempted to at least hint at in the gameplay examples. <br/><br/>That's almost an invitation for "blank page" syndrome, but I found when people had trouble most often it was fitting in the card Prompt (I added more low specificity options on the cards after that).<br/><br/>The basic game idea is: what is a very spontaneous play style that could have tension and complications injected from the game itself (Prompts deck). <br/><br/>Game written in reaction to House Of Reeds. Inspiration taken from In A Quiet Year obviously. <br/><br/>Who would want to play this game? The intended audience is gamers who already play story games. A quick pick up free game when no one is in the mood to play _____ again quite so soon.<br/><br/>In play test it was often players who had never played a story game before, but almost invariably with RPG experience. So possibly a game to introduce players to story games.<br/><br/>Quality of the stories in 5 playtests most reminded me of the Follow games I've played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466517/#Comment_466517" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T15:11:56+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  3:11PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Assuming I understood this correctly, a follow-up question: what kind of creative motivations do you envision a group to have when they play this?

And rather than injecting self-made problems ala Fiasco or Follow, have the unknown factor as the Prompts deck. Unbounded genre and setting. <br/><br/>I see the Prompts deck as a source of challenge, so that MDA aesthetic is touched on. But primarily expression, fantasy, narrative, in that order, with a little bit of discovery &amp; challenge.<br/><br/>In play the game was not so unbounded as might seem at first look. The P &amp; Q rules are very open, a skeleton really. The Schism play set brings a fair degree of structure. Additional play sets would also be structured.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466519/#Comment_466519" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T20:32:45+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  8:32PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2017 10:09PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mongrel,<br/>Out of the three playtest of <b>P&amp;Q: Schism </b> that I've take part in. The first playtest created the best story, the second the second best story, and the third the third best story. The third story in particular had less surprises and interest than the first two playtests. This may have just been that particular night but I feel as though something else played a role: by having four options to choose from the cards didn't lend themselves to having to interpret the prompts in a more limited way, and therefore the interpretions were less creative, original and unexpected. They didn't throw as many wrenches into the narrative. Just because players say they have to strain and be creative to interpret and incorporate a prompt into the story doesn't necessarily make it a good idea to add extra options. The worse that would happen if a prompt didn't work was that a new card would be drawn. So I suggest that you limit prompts to 2-3 per card. Especially if you see the pattern manifest again in future playtesting. I also suggest that you do an analysis of the prompts during play test, keep track of the card numbers and which prompts worked in the narrative and which didn't.  Over a lot of play testing you will find which prompts create the best stories. Anyway, I think by constraining choices, the stores will actually come out more interesting, novel and creative. Just my two cents. I 100% believe that with time and with play testing the game can be great; it's already a good game.  I definitely recommend that other story game forum members give it a try and playtest it.

In this case of Schism the players have a PC. I've toyed with ideas for different play sets in which there is one shared protagonist, or 3 shared "PCs". In this case it was just a design decision to have one PC per player, probably inspired by what I've been exposed to most so far (Fiasco &amp; Follow the biggest examples here). <br/><br/>I think I'll opt to keep world building first. It's been interesting watching first time story gamers as you give them this degree of creative latitude on the world creation. They seem to have a good time with it. Story tended to be emergent, but usually tied to scarcity/disillusionment in the society at large (a ghost story tied to a barrow mound was the exception). <br/><br/>That would be interesting to flip the set up upside down and create characters before establishing a world. That would probably be an easier set up for story gamers with more experience, but maybe not.<br/><br/>Secrets is interesting, because some players create their own between turns, and most don't. To not have the secrets as public knowledge they then influenced things "behind the scenes". If made public the whole table could use the secrets to move the story. I guess I'm torn on that point.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I would assume (sans play) that in practice that list boils down to "do what's necessary to maintain the story while fulfilling the prompt", and the real structure and authoritative impulse for a player's turn comes from the prompt card.</p></div></blockquote>\nExactly. <br/><br/>Invariably when players had difficulty during their turn it was how to work a Prompt into the story. I don't recall anyone having more than a momentary pause when considering the choice of technique (narration? frame a scene? group discussion? etc) for introducing the prompted story element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
