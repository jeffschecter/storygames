Maybe everyone is on their feet for roleplaying in-character or fiddling with dice and tables would interrupt the flow. In this case, the scene host or GM can phrase a question that is resolved by a show of fingers.\n<pre><code>RESOLVE TECHNIQUE - FREEFORM FINGER FLOW<br/>- Scene host / GM phrases a question<br/>- All players involved including scene host take part in decision<br/>- Fingers are shown simultaneously on count of three, similar to rock-paper-scissors<br/>- Each person shows one hand, presenting 0-5 fingers<br/>- Even total number of fingers means YES<br/>- Odd total number of fingers means NO<br/>- Number of fingers defines Strength of outcome<br/>- Total number of 0 fingers (no fingers) is YES with maximum possible strength<br/>- Before showing fingers, each person is free to state their intention, <br/>  including misleading others</code></pre>\n<i>Example 1:<br/>Three players  show fingers: <br/>First player shows 2 fingers, second shows 3 fingers, third shows 1 finger<br/>Total number of fingers is 6 (even)<br/>Result is YES with strength 6 (of 15 possible fingers)<br/><br/>Example 2:<br/>Three players  show fingers: <br/>First player shows 4 fingers, second shows 0 fingers, third shows 1 finger<br/>Total number of fingers is 5 (odd)<br/>Result is YES with strength 6 (of 15 possible fingers)<br/><br/>Example 3:<br/>Three players show fingers:<br/>First player shows 0 fingers, second shows 0 fingers, third shows 0 fingers<br/>Total number of fingers is 0 (counted as even)<br/>Result is YES with maximum possible strength<br/><br/>Example 4:<br/>Three players  show fingers:<br/>First player shows 0 fingers, second shows 0 fingers, third shows 5 fingers<br/>Total number of fingers is 5 (odd)<br/>Result is NO with strength 5 (of 15 possible fingers)</i><br/><br/>In example 3, the group succeeded in communicating in advance that they were aiming for a "big YES".<br/>In example 4, the stated intention was the same. However, the third player fooled the group and went for a strong NO.<br/><br/>This has been developed as a quick, smooth &amp; effective resolve technique.<br/>Your feedback is highly welcome.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446223/#Comment_446223" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T18:27:19+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  6:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446245/#Comment_446245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T01:04:07+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  1:04AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assume this is a hack of my "Oracle", from "As the Worm Turns...".<br/><br/>As you can imagine, I approve of this, since it's exactly what I invented it for in the first place.<br/><br/>It does have some odd features, like all players aiming for a "no" result resulting in a "yes" (if there is an odd number of players).<br/><br/>I would also increase the "critical range", personally, as otherwise it won't come up too often, and put it at both ends, as I did in my original Oracle.

There, he is using 0-5 fingers for a push vote. When you came up with "The Oracle", this was also a huge inspiration indeed! It inspired me to use finger voting more often. Also, you brought in the 'devil's advocate' twist.<br/>I played around with various finger voting methods (mostly for freeform storytelling in public spaces) and opted for the described method above (Freeform Finger Flow) because it works fast &amp; simple with interesting results.<br/>Overall, it's not supposed to be <i>exact science</i>. For my purpose, which is supporting my current project <i>Spy Tears (Directions Storyplaying System)</i>, it's enough to come up with a strong/weak Yes or No.<br/><br/>2097:<br/>Thanks. As you've guessed, you end up with "I think, that you think, that I think, that you think..." situations. Basically, you can't really know what will come up. You can just decide if you want to go in with less risk (less fingers), more fingers or possibly even be vulnerable with an all or nothing 0 fingers.<br/>Usually, when you play with a GM, he will be enough to put a monkey wrench in the guess work. For collaborative GM-less play, it is possible to come up with exactly what you want - then again, someone could surprise you...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446376/#Comment_446376" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T19:04:47+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  7:04PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want meh you put in 1 finger.
