But I think it went like this...<br/><br/>The cards are all things that I did when I was in my late teens, and that I remember as intense experiences. They're typical of what happens to you, what seems meaningful, at that time when...:<br/>- Your body suddenly becomes more aware, exploding with sensations and emotions. <br/>- So does everybody else's.<br/>- You need to challenge new boundaries, and test whether what they've told you is true.<br/><br/>But there wasn't a lot of thinking involved. It was a very intuitive process - meaning that one mental process just came up with things that fit, and the other wrote them down in game form*. <br/><br/>Now, the cards are all meant to be fairly universal and bendable - while at the same time evoking just that episode, that emotion, that you yourself once experienced. When I say "remember from your youth, that time you talked all night?", I'm pretty sure you have an immediate response - a specific situation comes up in your head. That will feed the game. <br/><br/>I've played this game just a handful of times. I've noticed that the two last cards - "Repeating motive" and "The creature" - just end up feeling forced. They feel unnecessary. Like giving someone a map to a place they already are at, or, rather, a map to somewhere they don't need to be because they're already where they ought to be. So I might just remove those if I played it now.<br/><br/>To me, this is one of those games that's just too simple to be proud of, but still works incrediby well. I find that is a problem with this category of games; you read them, they look like something anyone could have thrown together (and they are, I guess), but if you try them out, you will feel different. At least I do.<br/><br/><br/><i>* While I write this, that first mental process apparently refuses to be categorized as "semi-conscious" etc, which is probably right, and I should get my brain checked to see what's actually going on with that divide. <br/><br/>Say, maybe this is why I'm not very good at talking about my design. The different parts of me that make some of these games aren't all equally verbal. <br/><br/>But all this is probably not helping you very much, so I'm putting it in a footnote here.<br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323743/#Comment_323743" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T09:49:09+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  9:49AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tangent:<br/>The Repeating Motif and The Creature cards struck me as being a bit out of place on a read-through of FY also. Maybe they could be used as some sort of optional card (perhaps along with a couple of others that stray from the main concept as well)?<br/><br/>I could see them being cards that turn up, but no one is exactly sure what to do with them, which then takes up one of the slots for the face up card choices until someone bites the bullet and picks one just to get it out of play.<br/><br/>That brings up another question:<br/>How and why did you decide to go with the three face up card choice mechanic? <br/><br/>Did you try ealier versions of the game where a card was simply drawn and players ran with it, or did you just skip ahead to the idea of having some choices always available?<br/><br/>Does having the three cards face up provide any godd or bad things in play notably?<br/><br/>For example, I could see a good aspect being that it tips other players to upcoming scenes and gets their creative juices going, but could be bad if they were really jazzed about their idea for a scene card on their turn only to have a previous player pick that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323746/#Comment_323746" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T09:58:14+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  9:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great read, and sounds like fun.<br/><br/>Did you ever experiment with slightly more detailed cards?

Lost in the mists of memory now, I'm afraid. But yes, it's all about having just enough choice. In another game I might tighten it down to two, but Fuck Youth isn't all that much about creative challenge - it's about inspiration and just enough input to help you do your thing.<br/><br/>I haven't really noticed any negative aspects, but as I said, I've only played it a few times. I might give it a rerun and see how I feel about it now.<br/><br/>Paul: I didn't experiment a whole lot with the cards here. I'm wary of too much detail in this specific game, as it's all about conjuring up your own experiences and memories and associations; however, in a different game, very detailed cards could be interesting just to see how varied the interpretations could be.
