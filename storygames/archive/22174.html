                    Sock &amp; Buskin Games announced it is conducting an open Alpha playtest of its new universal narrative roleplaying system, Luna. This is an unusual move since the game is untested. However, the company decided to open it up to the public to help guide the development of the game at this early stage.<br/><br/>We’re trying some mechanics and an approach to roleplaying that I haven’t seen before. “Most companies will keep a game like this close to their chest until they feel it’s ready. I wanted to get some early feedback from our audience to make sure we’re moving in the right direction.” Instead of trying to simulate a fictional reality, Luna facilitates the creation of a shared fiction. This is a rare opportunity for gamers to help shape a new roleplaying game from the ground up.<br/><br/>Luna System is under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, allowing for free use for personal and commercial products.<br/>Luna System Alpha Playtest Edition is available through <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/282463/Luna-System" rel="nofollow">DriveThruRPG.com</a> and <a href="https://sockandbuskingames.com/product/luna-system/" rel="nofollow">SockandBuskinGames.com</a>.<br/><br/>If you have any questions or answers as to problems with this game, let's get to discussing!                </div>
