When someone has a bad time playing the game, one possible cause is certainly "incompatible CAs." But I could also be unhappy because I lost, or because someone was a dick to me, or because there were too many Monty Python jokes at the table. In other words, "conflict" could occur for reasons unrelated to CA-incompatiblity. Was Nathan Herrold unhappy at the table because of CA-incompatibility, or because he found the situation in which his character was engaged to be unappealing? Was Anna Kreider upset by CA-incompatibility or did she just really strongly identify with her character?

That said, I think we make more progress when we have a problem with what it <i>is</i> saying than when we have a problem with something it's not saying.<br/><br/>Roleplayers engage in exploration in different ways; as I said, that is uncontroversial in the extreme. CA isn't about how people do exploration; it's about which conceptions of what-gaming-even-<i>is</i> lead to games that break up, or might as well break up. That's the only definition of Creative Agenda that's ever been coherent (in a non-jargony sense) enough to engage with. <br/><br/>Definitions of G, N, and S are a different deal. *AHEM* According to the Big Model:\n<ul>\n<li>Narrativist play is play in which <i>all players</i> are empowered to address premise - where "premise" is defined per Lajos Egri as a particular form of ideological question - as a part of their in-game actions. That's not tied specifically to "moral/ethical/anthropological judgment," although it will more than likely include some.<br/></li>\n<li>Gamist play is play in which challenge is socially paramount - challenge isn't exactly the same as competition (challenge is <i>one mode</i> of competition, essentially the non-sneaky mode).<br/></li>\n<li>Simulationist play is... well, people agree on this one the least often, but it certainly isn't defined precisely by exploration-for-its-own-sake. (I happen to be partial at the moment to Vincent's definition of "peer-appreciated wish fulfillment," but to get the full nuance of that it really helps to read those recent Right-To-Dream threads at lumpley.com. Oh god, now I'm shunting people off to read some thread on another site, like a proper Forge Twunt.)</li>\n</ul>\nI don't want to be the resident pissy pedant - really! - and maybe I'm just indulging my Internet twitchiness in a non-admirable way right now, but this is as succinctly as I know how to put them. <br/><br/>And truthfully, yeah, this stuff is less important than the latter question of Sean's, of whether it is really more effective to target a design at just one of the (alleged) CA families.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214468/#Comment_214468" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T00:51:50+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2009 1:14AM by frozenwastes.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><br/>There are some folks who are all, "Yeah, Sim doesn't really exist."

Or more accurately, YES, YES, YES! WITH THE FURY OF A THOUSAND SUNS, YES!"<br/><br/>Right after I listened to your podcast episode, I went and revisted all those "Beeg horseshoe" and "Sim doesn't exist" threads all over the Forge and people's blog.<br/><br/>I think such thought has entirely to do with the baggage of the term way back to the rfga and game outpost discussions.  It ended up producing this notion that gamism and narrativism were defined by what they were but sim was defined by what it wasn't.  So whenever people were looking for sim, they'd see an element of gam or nar and say "oh, looks like it's not sim" when all they were doing was assuming in advance that their positive definitions of gam and nar always trumps their negative definitions of sim.\n<blockquote>We can see agonistic play as it happens and we can see mimetic play as it happens; can we see thematic play as it happens?

And, to cap it all off, what about the fact that even in the absence of thematic intentions on our part, others can still read our play as addressing some sort of premise?</blockquote>\nYour putting my thoughts into words better than I have so far.  These are exactly the questions I was trying to get at.  Let me suggest that academic artistic criticism has done a far more thorough job of addressing the subject of theme than RPG theory.  Especially literary criticism.  Without getting too far into deconstruction, I think all those same questions apply to any statements made by the participants of RPG play that apply to the author-text-reader relationship in literature.\n<blockquote>In other words, "conflict" could occur for reasons unrelated to CA-incompatiblity. Was Nathan Herrold unhappy at the table because of CA-incompatibility, or because he found the situation in which his character was engaged to be unappealing? Was Anna Kreider upset by CA-incompatibility or did she just really strongly identify with her character? And how do you tell?</blockquote>\nThe easiest way might be to ask.  More interesting though, are the questions raised by the fact that the easiest way might be to ask.  You get to why asking might not work below, but assuming that people will take the time to reflect and be honest and tell you and themselves what's actually the case, asking is pretty much the best way to get around trying to guess what's going on in people's heads during a specific moment of play.  I'll concede the point for the purpose of discussion though and carry on below.\n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Calithena</cite>The question is what you're doing with your exploration (aka 'roleplaying'). If the activity is undertaken for its own sake, that's S. If the activity is used as a form of social 'competition', that's gamism. And if it's used to exercise moral/ethical/anthropological judgment, it's N.</blockquote>\nOkay, I like that. The issue is still "How do you tell?" though, right? You can't just ask people, though, because they might be kidding themselves. So how do you know it when you see it?</blockquote>\nFirst of all, I don't like that.  I find Calithena's definition of the Right to Dream to be the usual negative definition nonsense that leads to people denying that the Right to Dream even exists.  Where as soon as you have a "sake" then it can't be RTD anymore because RTD is for it's own sake.  I would say rather than the Right to Dream is pursued for the sake of getting it right.  Where "it" is the exploration of a particular element and "right" is a mimetic relationship with source material (even if that source material is limited to merely what has been established in play so far).<br/><br/>So how do you tell, assuming you can't trust the person's answers if you ask them directly?  I'm not sure you can.  I think instead you approach it as if you can't know and ask the question "how can I address the dissatisfaction with play in both cases?".  If Nathan Herrold's dissatisfaction is with the situation, then what can you put into the game procedures to ensure that only pleasing situations are created?<br/><br/>That's assuming that the goal of the analysis is to improve satisfaction during play.\n<blockquote>Disentangling S and N is hard! Exactly my problem, and the reason why I suspect that one doesn't "really exist" in the way the other does.</blockquote>\nIf I had to pick a candidate for which should be considered a subset of the other, I'd go with Story Now! as the exercising of the Right to Dream with the "it" being the exploration of a story element (specifically the common convention of genres to make thematic statements). <b> If you play Story Now, all you're doing is attempting to get mimetic play that concerns itself with getting the thematic elements of the source material (the current genre you are playing) to appear during play.</b><br/><br/>But that might just be my desire to stick it to the all the "sim doesn't exist" people.  It felt good either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214471/#Comment_214471" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T01:41:57+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  1:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Categories like GNS exist solely to give people a way to talk about games.

That being said, there is definitely a big separation between competitive or aggressive play and everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve experienced players that bring their style of competitive play to non-competitive games with negative results.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, we will play a non-competitive game that isn\u2019t about winning or strategy\u2026 games where having your character lose is as much fun as having them win as long as it showcases who they are. And these competitive players sometimes bring a form of social competition to the game. Who can tell the coolest story? Who can come up with the most dramatic conflict? Which is on the surface fine. But it often leads to telling other people their ideas suck in the infancy stage or butting in with comments like \u201cdo you know what would be waaay cooler than that?\u201d In effect, making non-competitive games highly competitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t know if this is a creative issue or purely a social one. Ultimately, this probably wouldn\u2019t be a problem in a group of like minded players. But when not everyone is on board, it sucks. And hell, I\u2019m a competitive person.

Exploration is what you do when you roleplay, it's imagining stuff. It takes place within a certain real-world social environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is that exploration leading? Exploration itself is fun, for a lot of people. (Myst. Sim City. 'Secrets' in Tekumel and Glorantha, or just going off the edge of the hex map and finding out what's there.) So there's no craziness about exporation feeding back into exploration, at all, RPing itself wouldn't work as a hobby if there wasn't some enjoyment in this.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who want to focus on that enjoyment and not get distracted with G or N are focusing on S. It's a little like, you can have ice cream with fruit, or you can have ice cream with chocolate syrup, or you can just have ice cream. We're the group who doesn't want any toppings on our ice cream, thank you. We're S-focused.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, historically speaking, was the seminal game for isolating G. That game communicated an approach in which going for G in the usual way was completely frustrated by the ruleset. So this separated the G from the anti-G, out of the incoherence which constituted many higher-concept D&amp;D;, Runequest, etc. campaigns at the time. (If your little part of the RPG world in 1980 was different from my little part, fine. This was how we perceived it and we weren't alone. Maybe there's a different example that works for you?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some specific other things that are very natural to do with that exploration. One is to make 'thematic' statements (I hate that fucking word with a passion, which is why I don't use it normally), that is, to engage one's own faculties of moral, ethical, religious, anthropological - value! - judgment and use the imaginative material as a way to approach that. (The idea that every player has to be empowered to do this individually for it to be N is wrong - that's an important principle of one kind of functional N design favored by some of the Forge designers in the time of the Big Model's construction, but it's not the only way for an RPG group to 'address premise' (another barf word for me).) Another is to use it for Step On Up or whatever other wank-ass term one uses for social display. Maybe there are others - I once thought that self-discovery was one, though this may just be a by-product of reflecting on what we do in any of the CAs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of CA-focus is the thing that still needs more clarity in my view, the rest of this is actually more basic than people make it out to be. CA focus has proven its ARTISTIC worth as a principle for designing new and interesting RPGs. But its THEORETICAL worth depends on its at least rough-and-ready truth, and I've more and more come to the view that there are at the very least some accessible limits in which Incoherent play is actually Coherent (in the technical sense - look at me, ma, I'm doin' theory talk!). It would be nice if there were a place where that could be debated seriously between friendly, principled interlocutors, but there's actual game stuff to write! Not to mention my job...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I really am out. Again, have fun, and - be excellent to each other!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214506/#Comment_214506" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T06:49:04+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  6:49AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You want to spend your time with pointless and circular arguments about arbitrary (but sometimes useful) terminology, then go ahead.

I'm talking about the idea that sim has often been defined as play that doesn't include the defining elements of nar or gam.  That's what I mean by negative.  Nar has X.  Gam has Y.  Sim is about not having X or Y.  That's what I mean by negative.  My contentous bolded statement is an example of this.\n<blockquote>The idea that it's negative to enjoy something for its own sake is absurd. Obviously I have some ulterior motive when I have an orgasm, I couldn't possibly enjoy that for its own sake. I suppose you could follow Aristotle and bump one more step back to 'happiness', but that would apply to everything.</blockquote>\nI don't think I'm saying what you think I'm saying.  I'm actually saying that an orgasm for its own sake is valid and that defining it so that if there's another sake, it is suddenly diminished isn't right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214509/#Comment_214509" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T07:05:15+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  7:05AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2009 7:11AM by Bill_White.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John -- The sort of thing you're describing is related to muy macho play but falls short of actually being muy macho because one of the principles of muy macho is that you only bring it out on people who can take it, and you have to be ready to get as good as you give.

It is extremely difficult to define it in terms that don't refer directly to the three identified families but that still make those families make sense together, and it's going to remain so.

Also, none of this is intended to suggest the primacy of the Big Model - I'm responding to this stuff at face value, as intellectual grist for the mill, so take it all in that context. I recognize that the Big Model is not the end all and be all of talking about play, kthxbye.<br><br>Also, anywhere you see "clearly X" or "this indicates Y", you can assume an unwritten, "My hearing/reading of this suggests ". That means if you don't hear what I say is there, you're probably not wrong. Kthxbye.<br><br>1.) The episode's first example was a poor choice IMO, and very out-of-scope with the discussion that followed it. That Gankagok game clearly failed because of issues with the procedures. Most of it was you explaining to the players how things are "supposed" to go, and then lots of awkward fumbling about trying to drive conflict without a GM. The issues were all technical - I mean, seriously, when you get to the point where you have to ask the question "do you want to roleplay some more or roll dice now" (I know, it uses cards), you're far away from any problems that have to do with creative agenda.<br><br>So it seemed ill-conceived to me to start talking about GNS after that, and my sense of disconnection moving from the example was strong.<br><br>2.) The second example was good, showing a pretty clear investment in Gamist priorities, but the discussion about Muy Macho and "fiction-based" Gamism unnecessarily muddied up the waters, because the example afterward didn't actually reflect what was described. There's no indication that the fiction in the third snippet was being used as an arena of competition/challenge at all, or that status among the players was being determined by who was putting the "best" fictional content forward, or that anyone even cared about any of that. <br><br>In fact, what *was* evident to me was a fairly consistent firing off of Narrativist payoffs - the "ooohs" and "ahhhs" surrounding the murderous action and its consequences, indicating a pretty active sense of moral judgment among the players. The decision seemed to land as something that had visceral, human meaning to the participants, and their reactions showed it. No muddied waters there, no maybe-Gamism, just straight-up Nar.<br/><br/>3.) The fourth example pretty much continued the trend of Narrativist priority and emphasis - I read it as pretty clear in this one that the players are rendering judgment on their characters and that there's more going on than just reacting to an expectation of "correct" output or trying to "win" in some way or another. <br/><br/>Anna's reactions specifically speak to this - her moral judgment as a player is all over that snippet... "Of course, douchewaffle is going to get a happy ending..." etc etc., and the passion with which she was willing to pursue murder herself at the end. I felt that as far as she was concerned, that dude *deserved* to die.<br/><br/>Now, a question: did Anna not have a good time at the game because of her emotional response? It seemed to me from the snippet that she was very invested in the game and fully engaged with it. I've read books where what happens frustrates me or makes me angry, and I generally find those to be extremely good books because of the level of engagement they provide.<br/><br/>4.) The Trail example doesn't really give any clear indication of what game content the players are invested in, and so can't really be used for a discussion about creative agenda at that table. It's clear that the choice to take the Stability damage got a reaction, but it's not clear why. You'd need to look at a longer example.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Re: this thread...<br/><br/>First of all, talking about creative agenda outside a group context is pretty much useless. By definition, individuals don't "play Sim" or "play Gamist", just like there's no actual such thing as a "Narrativist game design". The shorthand exists because it gets tiresome to write "plays in a way that might be highly endorsed in a Gamist environment" or "is ideal for supporting a Narrativist agenda at the table" over and over again. Historically, taking that shorthand literally has muddied up the discussion a lot more than I'd like.<br/><br/>So, if you pull off the awezume combo of phat moves and wipe out the big orc leader, and no one else cares, and no one else ever cares, Gamism is simply not happening at that table. The social emphasis and support has to be there as a trend, a pattern of behavior in the group. That's what CA clash is - other people failing to support and engage the stuff that turns you on, and you failing to support and engage the stuff that turns other people on.<br/><br/>So asking something like, "Well, what about the fact that you can read a premise into my actions that I'm not trying to put forward?" is pretty much a red herring - what you intend or don't intend is immaterial. Better questions to ask are, "Does it matter to anyone when my character makes a momentous decision? Does it affect anyone on a human level, as players? Do people get emotional about those moments? Do we, as a group, tend to plug into that a lot? Do they care if I make a decision that's "wrong" for the character, or is that meaningful to them somehow?" Those are the kinds of questions that help lead you to identifying a shared agenda (or lack of shared agenda) in a particular group.<br/><br/>That's why the Trail snippet from the podcast falls flat. There's really just not enough there for you to get a sense of what everyone's invested in and emphasizing socially. The roleplaying almost seems ancillary to the conflict - in a couple of places, the mechanical action was only retroactively justified by narration, and no one really reacted to it; it seemed just to be necessary to explain the rolling.<br/><br/>Likewise, Anna's emotional state at the end of the fourth snippet doesn't really tell you anything about CA - she could say, "I was upset because I identified with my character" or "I was upset because the story didn't go the way I wanted" and this wouldn't be useful information one way or the other. What *would* be useful is looking at everyone's level of investment in that particular instance, trying to figure out what it was they were engaging with, and examining how they expressed it... and then, mapping that to behavioral trends in that group.<br/><br/>That's how you tell. You look at what game content people are supporting when they react to stuff and are engaged, why they have those reactions, and (most importantly) what trends emerge in that support over time. <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for reading my lengthy ramble.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214587/#Comment_214587" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T12:46:20+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>And, not for nothing, but I think some of us are guilty of bad form in this thread.

The concrete example was someone having their character do something inappropriate for that character in order to artificially address premise.  Basically using pawn stance to pursue Story Now! instead of instead of its typical use in Step On Up.<br/><br/>The response was that it's not about violating exploration of character, but about having characters appropriate to play goals.  That a character is unfit for Story Now!<br/><br/>GNS has almost always been about fixing play that's not working.  So it would make sense that we should be able to identify thematic play when someone has an unfit character.<br/><br/>Or are we back at square one because a character that is unfit for the exploration of themes is always going to also be unfit for the exploration of anything else the game could be about?  Addressing theme as character exploration/celebration rather than to communicate a statement on a moral matter to other participants?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214600/#Comment_214600" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T14:57:52+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  2:57PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm entirely agnostic about defining or enjoying Right to Dream play.

I'm sitting in my brokedick car right now a mile or two south of the PA RenFaire (not where I'm headed, though) waiting for a tow truck. Thank God for the Blackberry. Anyway, Leonard Balsera whispered me a really tough critique of the argument in the podcast; I told him he could unwhisper it at his leisure.<br/><br/>Leonard's critique begins with the observation that the problems in the first excerpt were procedural; I'm not sure that's entirely true. Although it's clear to me that I should have "gone to the mechanics" when I thought it was appropriate rather than offering the player a chance to develop the situation more--altough that sometimes works when the player has a strong vision of the character. In any event, there's more going on there than just procedural issues; there're fictional ones as well: the situation is hand-waved in a few places (I should have pushed to nail those down). And there are social ones: I roped Nathan into playing, even though he was a stranger, so I felt more than normally responsible for his fun. So while there were procedural issues, they stemmed from the totality of the situation rather than from just the procedures. The procedural issues were a manifestation of some larger disconnect, in other words. <br/><br/>But Leonard's larger point that you don't need to go to GNS to explain that disconnect is well-taken. So I can say that's a point I'll take away from this discussion, and try to apply in the future. The level that I'm operating at seems to be immediate orientations to play, and it seems to be the case there that GNS steers you wrong.<br/><br/>Leonard's next point is that the third excerpt is not a good example of being muy macho; okay, that's a fair cop. I'm not sure I accept Leonard's stronger claim thougl: that it didn't seem particularly competitive. He's right that player status didn't seem to hinge on diplaying narrative skill, but it seemed to some appreciation for incisive play. However, that is located in the moment of play rather than the larger cycle of play and reward.<br/><br/>Leonard winds up saying that the thing to do is look at what people engage with, and why, and use that as a guide for further action. I like that a lot. My one methodological deal is that I want to see how much can be achieved just from listening to actual play, but I recognize that it's just one arrow in the quiver.<br/><br/>I hope Leonard unwhispers his post; it's really good stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214691/#Comment_214691" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T12:23:32+00:00" title="June 27, 2009 12:23PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2009 12:23PM by NomdePlume.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nathanh</cite><br/><br/>Many of the most vocal proponents of Story Now have put forward the idea that Right to Dream play is a form of null play at best and at worst a form of "simulation by habit" from dysfunctional play of traditional games.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm startled to read this, since I have never seen that.

There are probably legions of RPers who Dream because, hey, what else are you supposed to do, right, if you don't know there's anything else?<br/><br/>But calling anything null play is only valid if the name-caller was directly involved in said play. Astaroth, my liege (ha, big Lovecraft fan ^_^), I agree with you - folks would only try to reduce the worth of anyone's preferred play style if they were mean, and jerks. <br/><br/>Nathan, you've made it very clear in our correspondence that what you and your group do is follow the Dream, to the point of being quite self-aware as to what you're doing, and you do it deliberately. That's all the proof anyone should need to know that a) Right to Dream is a perfectly viable play style, and b) it doesn't have to ape or fall prey to the habits of traditional play. Doesn't <i>have</i> to, mind; plenty of people choose to, and those of us (like yourself) who seem to be breaking away from that a bit (with your talk of Story Before and After, for example, which moves your Dreaming into meta-game territory without lessening the experience; kudos!) are doing something different than "good old D&amp;D". <br/><br/>Also, Nathan,<br/><br/>Not sure if I've already mentioned this to you, but from my own Actual Play experiences, I'm pretty doubtful of what seems to be a totalistic consensus on CA - just because it doesn't seem to be G doesn't mean it's definitely N or S; nor are the three modes strictly "adjacent" - i.e. if I'm not quite doing Story Now "correctly", I don't automatically fall into Right to Dream territory. The derivation of this is: sometimes game mechanics just don't work very well. In my experiences with playtesting <i>The Hellenes</i>, I've noticed that we aren't really trying to capture Greece "correctly" as our main goal; with our Kickers and so on, we're definitely exploring Character instead (duty, family, etc.), with the Greco-Persian Wars as a backdrop, not the "point" of play.<br/><br/>Given that, I've noticed my mechanics aren't really encouraging hard choices or putting much moral weight into the situation; as such, it's not that we've suddenly stormed off into Dream lands. Rather, it's just bad Story Now ^_^ I'm happy to have made this distinction, and I rescind my comments about the "Story Now" end of the "Right to Dream" pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214786/#Comment_214786" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T01:13:32+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  1:13AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I agreed with you about the Story end of the Dream pool, I was talking about one CA being in support of another, or using techniques that traditionally support one to support another.

I figured I missed a large part of the context because I was only getting the audio. \n<blockquote>The level that I'm operating at seems to be immediate orientations to play, and it seems to be the case there that GNS steers you wrong.</blockquote>\nI tend to talk about that more in terms of socketing now, using Mo's stuff, or talking about specific technical preferences. For example, a large part of why some people I know disconnect from PTA is because it tends to encourage a lot of time in author stance when the player might not really want to be there. This has nothing to do with Narrativism, so if I'm discussing that issue with a player, I don't bring up Narrativism. And if I choose, after that discussion, not to play PTA with that person, it doesn't mean that person wouldn't be happy in a Narrativist group. It just means that person doesn't like PTA.<br/><br/>Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, etc etc.\n<blockquote>However, that is located in the moment of play rather than the larger cycle of play and reward.</blockquote>\nYeah, overall, I didn't feel like it was acknowledged to that great a degree. There was a bigger response *after* the verdict had been laid down of "You watch the light go out of his eyes and you know deep inside you that this is very different, very wrong." If you want to get even more confusing, you could read that reaction as enjoying how the input and output matched up... which might be a Sim payoff. Oy.\n<blockquote>Leonard winds up saying that the thing to do is look at what people engage with, and why, and use that as a guide for further action. I like that a lot.

That moment when everyone goes "ooohhhh" over a decision that gets made - there's something in that moment. Enough of those somethings tells you about CA. But at the point where all you have is the reaction, it's like raw data, right? It has to be evaluated and put into a larger context.<br/><br/>(By the way, didn't GNS get removed as a general term from the Model in favor of CA precisely to make room for things besides G, N, or S to get acknowledged as valid inputs for it?

"The aesthetic priorities and any matters of imaginative interest regarding role-playing. Three distinct Creative Agendas are currently recognized..."<br/><br/>"Skewers" are an interesting, related topic: <i>A description of a given person?s preferred way to role-play, "piercing" down from Social Contract through all the layers of the Big Model. Most player-classification lists (Strike Force, Champions 4th edition, Robin?s Laws) present Skewers. Term coined by Ron Edwards.</i> <br/><br/>However, given that CAs are matters of aesthetic and imaginative interest and priority, I don't see there being much room for anything else in Skewers that's distinct, aside from, say, social context. <br/><br/>Dang old totalistic theories don't leave anything but bones! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>One last thing: if it's a moment where *everyone* oohs and aahs over a moment in the game, then we probably have a stable, group-wide CA. As a player involved in that moment, I (or whomever) should be able to identify which CA it falls into, and whether that has thus far been the main subject of play (as opposed to "Well, we were playing regular d&amp;d but then Jerry's fighter sacrificed his son so the winds would change, and we got all quiet at the table. Max started crying a little". This is my imaginary incoherent-play-becomes-Nar-for-a-moment scenario). <br/>Edwards writes about this a good bit in the Story Now essay - he describes a group that's content to drive without Bangs for long periods of time, making decisions without any thematic weight, and then, once in a while, something really awesome happens. Watch the group talk about that story, and that alone, for years to come. At least, that's his looking-down-the-nose stereotype he has of unfulfilled gamers. <br/>I'm of the opinion that good system *plus* good players and GM equals best time possible; the reverse of "System Does Matter" is, of course, that "Players Still Matter". The latter includes GMs, of course. <br/>Part of being a good player, arguably, is knowing what kind of play you like, and being able to ask for/push for it at the conversation level and within the game itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214870/#Comment_214870" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T12:25:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2009 12:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Leonard">@Leonard</a>:<br/>Yes - that's explicitly stated in the definition of Creative Agenda - that GNS are simply three already-agreed-upon possibilities.

And, yes, I think immersion has different priorities from Right to Dream. Call it Right to Be, if you like; of course, that sounds a bit too much like the other one.<br/>But yeah - in my limited view of the Scandinavian 7-day LARPs, it seems like Right to Dream is about some level of out-of-fiction/metagame positioning to make sure we maintain the Dream correctly. The different "stances" are not at all limited in their utility for the three current CAs; just because you're Dreaming doesn't mean you can't have Author or Director stance. With Immersion, though, it might could be that metagame is actually the enemy of Fun. <br/><br/>I heard a proposal for a CA at rpg.net: Mysterism. In my opinion, it's a reactive attempt to discredit techniques of player agency and overt metagame discussion, as well as to come down firmly in the long-standing psuedo-debate about IC/OCC information. In other words, I don't see it as particularly helpful, at least in its presentation. However, I think its big limitation is that it primarily indicates a preferred GM/player power relationship; aesthetic considerations don't seem to really be part of it, per se. In that respect, it could be called functional Illusionism, and then we're right back where we started. At the same time, it renames Illusionism to give it less of a negative connotation, for folks who genuinely enjoy that kind of thing. No wonder why this idea hasn't made its way to the Forge, of course...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214893/#Comment_214893" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T14:30:20+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  2:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 2:30PM by Bill_White.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Seriously, I'd be all about voting Immersionism in as a fourth recognizable CA, differentiated from the other three.

"Filling the hollow man with stupid," was one of the principles I remember, illustrated by a story about non-German-speaking Finnish larpers playing Nazi soldiers whose limited German vocabularies--"Waffen haben. Cigaretten haben"--made it easier to play grunts in a WWII larp. But an underlying assumption of the lecture was exactly as Zac suggests: the challenge is to stay in character, to <i>live</i> in character, and it is that more than anything else that defines "success" or "fun." That seemed really different to me, but perhaps I'm just provincial. So call it Immersionism, or call it Simulationism oriented around Exploration of Character and instantiated in a particular suite of Techniques. The former course emphasizes the diversity of imaginative interests that people bring to play; the latter emphasizes how different orientations to the fiction and varying game-mechanical procedures can produce widely different experiences of play even when people are generally agreed on what the point of playing is in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215056/#Comment_215056" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T09:55:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  9:55AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trouble with communication online (one of the many troubles, that is) is that when you're wrong, and then later clarify yourself?
