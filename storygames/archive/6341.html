Steampunk is a sort of odd "genre" in that it has all the elements of modern society, just tweaked slightly.  This avoids the problems that you can sometimes find in, say, fantasy social commentary, because the presence of magic and the absence of technology (not to mention the absence of, say, democracy) skews things slightly.  Steampunk does not have this problem, but any modern-day theme that you might want to talk about has a suitably distanced foil in steampunk -- familiar technology becomes all whirring gears and steam pipes, culture wars become victorian class struggles, corporations become trade houses, and so on.  And while they all have curious idiosyncracies and all, they're never (or at least, rarely) so far off the original mark that they can't stand in quite capably for their modern complements in any thematic statement or consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140771/#Comment_140771" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T05:23:37+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  5:23AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm with Mark.

Racisim, Sexism, Classism, repressed sexuality, extreme poverty, diseases and so on.  The big thing is that where today we mostly try to avoid those things and work to reduce them, back then for the most part...not only were they accepted they were considered a part of Right Thinking.  Of course the poor don't matter, of course women aren't as good as men, and of course non caucasian peoples were inferior and the West was doing them a favor by civilizing them...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to play Steam Punk as something more than just quirky tech fluff, means to enter into an age where the roots of our issues today are on full display and encounter them in that context.  Just try to play a right thinking aristrocratic gentlemen without either 1) bringing in anachonistic modern egalitarian sensibilities or 2) turning him into a hateful caricature.  Try playing a true honest to god period hero...who just happens to adhere to all of society's mores.  Oh he may be willing to accept a particular talented woman on her own merits, but he'll do so in full recognition that she's a rare exception to her gender.  He may have a particular man of color that he treats with respect due to some special circumstance in their past, but for the most part such people are invisible except when service is required.  He may help the poor but he does so because they can't help what they are...a product of bad breeding.  Try to play this person as sympathetically as possible, and see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what I think steam punk allows.  It allows us to explore just how easy that thinking is to fall into and compare it to how easily it is to fall into it yet today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Steam Punk is just the catalyst for throwing society into turmoil.  For compressing 100 years of technological development into 10.  For envisioning computers without the civil rights and feminist movements in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141563/#Comment_141563" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T02:07:24+00:00" title="April 29, 2008  2:07AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2008 2:09AM by Johnstone.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>:</b><br><br>The term "steampunk" came from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Difference_Engine" rel="nofollow">The Difference Engine</a> by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling.

But are there steam engines in his stories? If he's in the genre, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_king_in_yellow" rel="nofollow">The King in Yellow</a> must be, too (written in 1895, set in 1920...). My dad was making post-apocalyptic steampunk comics in the 1970s. Were they Victorian at all? Not really, but they had steam engines in them...<br><br/>So, what is "steampunk" really about? You could check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk" rel="nofollow">the wikipedia entry</a>. A quick summation? It started as early science fiction. When the sci-fi genre advanced with the times, some people looked back at the old sci-fi and used it for influence. Then they started writing alternate history sci-fi where obsolete technology was put to difference uses. Then it turned into an aesthetic or style, a "look." Nobody ever really embodied the genre enough to give it a distinctive stamp, unlike cyberpunk.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141566/#Comment_141566" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T03:46:58+00:00" title="April 29, 2008  3:46AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Steampunk is about revival of Victorian-era futurism, with all the attendant sexism, racism, and colonialism, in a "cool new" dress-up.</blockquote>\nNot a fan, Ben?

It harkens back to an age when science was a glorious, positive thing. When scientists and explorers faced mystery and danger with a strong mind and a strong heart. Where voyaging to Mars was as much about impressing the Martian Emperor with your genteel manners as it was building your Marvelous Invention. These type of games are about the reinvention/rediscovery of lost futures. <br/><br/>Second: Steampunk stories.<br/><br/>These are the stories of the underbelly of the past. By moving a story from the present to a psuedo-history one can give the themes of poverty, struggle, class conflict a new poignancy. It allows the players a mental distance. Cyberpunk does this, as all science fiction should. It allows us to analyze our world by emphasizing certain elements and allowing us space to step away from issues to get a bigger picture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144149/#Comment_144149" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T07:50:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  7:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, steampunk is about a sense of wonder mixed with oddity. It is about finding complicated ways to do simple things. Like reinventing the wheel just to brush your teeth, and feeling a sense of accomplishment when it doesn't kill you.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144172/#Comment_144172" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T08:54:11+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  8:54AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  To me, its about the dystopia.<br/>\n  If you look at that era, you can see a lot of "big" antagonists. Oil barons, rail barons, across the pond, a growing empire. This is an era where communication is more reliable (steam power, free press and cheap paper) and people can overcome most basic barriers to travel. With the advent of steam power, a calm wind will not stop the progress. And while we have a huge boom of technology, it is mostly only available or driven by those with the power/money. Look at Babbage's engines. He had the knowledge, innovation and all the necessary skills to make the engine, but the control/cost of the manufacturing facilities prevented the advent of the first ever programmable computer.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144266/#Comment_144266" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:41:34+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:41PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its about whatever you can shoehorn it into. On the surface its been about steam engines and zeppelins, vagabonds an dystopian pasts, computers that are purely mechanical and two guys on special train fighting ex-confederate mad men. It could just as easily be about a clockwork man looking for insight  into his own creation and life. It doesn't have to be alternate history, since it can be set somewhere else (The future, another world, or New Jersey 1975)<br/>\n<br/>\nSure it has genre tropes, the fetishism of archaic technology is one, but it could just as easily be the backdrop of some sort of social ill. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly its about what you as a creator and writer can convince people its about. Its sort of like how Sci-fi has radically changed from Jules Vernes "From the Earth to the Moon" to Battlestar Galactica. Both are Science Fiction, but both do it differently. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah it sucks to say its what you make of it, but beyond a basic feel thats really all Steam Punk is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
