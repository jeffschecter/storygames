Andy what do you think ?<br/><br/>So, in my ongoing effort to make as many RBH hacks as there are IAWA oracles out there, I am working on a pulp action / tomb raiding hack.<br/>The PCs are professionnal treasure hunters and villain busters.<br/><br/>I already outlined 7 character classes with some talents but I'd like some outside input.<br/><br/>Here are the classes :<br/><br/>\u2022 Ace {ace pilot / leader / movie star / billionaire} <br/>\u2022 Brawler {martial artist / soldier...} <br/>\u2022 Erudite {archeologist / scholar...} <br/>\u2022 Occultist {medium / hypnotist / stage magician...}<br/>\u2022 Science hero {gadgeteer / mad scientist / man from the future...}<br/>\u2022 Snooper {spy / gentleman thief / detective}<br/>\u2022 Survivor {hunter / cow boy / jungle lord }<br/><br/>Can you give me some talents ideas ? You can outline the mechanics or just indicate the general idea of the talents. I mainly searching for concepts.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'll just remind you the talents creation advices from Eric :<br/><br/>"Here's the guidelines that are in my head when I'm writing talents:<br/><br/>   1. Every talent must pass the First Level Test. If this one talent was the only cool ability your character can have for an extended period of time, would it be satisfying on it's own?<br/>   2. Talents come in two flavors: Things that you can do better than everyone else and things you can do that no one else can. I tried to make sure that every class had a few of each. When I was writing up the first list of talents I tried really hard to lean on the latter.<br/>   3. No talent should be dependant on a situation that the player isn't going to be in control of bringing to the table. A lot of anti-trap talents didn't make it into the game because I didn't want to assume that the GM would regularly be bringing in traps for the trap-character to use their talent on.<br/>   4. No time limits or limited uses. No per day, per week, per session, per combat, per this, or per that talents. The awesomeness of a character should be unlimited.<br/>   5. Simpler talents are better talents. But complex talents are ok when they aren't cluttering up the page.<br/>   6. I like it when the most obvious combos of talents are cross-class talents.<br/>   7. Every talent must pass the Plays Well With Others Test. Is this talent unique enough that it wouldn't be boring to cross-class with any of the other talents? You wouldn't want to have two talents that are effectively the same thing, and I don't want to give you that option."<br/><br/>Thanks for your help.<br/>Long live the Hack,<br/>Antoine                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
