The basic model I've followed so far is to use the F&amp;R to establish:\n<ul>\n<li>Who the characters are (normal people, Investigators, government agents, etc.)</li>\n<li>The rough circumstances leading to their memory loss (physiological/psychological trauma, exposure to Unspeakable Horrors, something on your last mission)</li>\n<li>Time frame (modern day, 1920s, modern day)</li>\n<li>Supernatural/Weirdness/Action level (none, Unspeakable Horrors, Tom Clancy)</li>\n</ul>\nThe last one is about establishing what I call the "circle of plausibility." The range of things that can happen in your stories can grow during play, but starting with a rough idea of what you want to be possible and what you don't is a useful tool.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220782/#Comment_220782" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T10:50:49+00:00" title="July 26, 2009 10:50AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>Did you get my email that told you I posted a Q&amp;A with you on Gamegrene.com?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamegrene.com/node/1019" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamegrene.com/node/1019</a></blockquote>\nYes I did, and I posted a link to it on the Orphic Institute's <a href="http://www.orphicinstitute.com/?page_id=12" rel="nofollow">Resources &amp; Downloads</a> page.

I was demo'ing Chris' Experimental Therapy and after the session the two players seemed very interested in the story/narrative parts of the game.  So, one quick run to the car to get my copy and we were off.  <br/><br/>I've not run if before so I tried to do the read as you go along thing.  We did ok except somehow I got the coin distribution method off.  This was likely because I rushed through something, the store was closing in a couple of hours and I tried to hit the ground running.  <br/><br/>Anyway, short scenario - there's the pennies in the bowl.  Everyone takes one and the Reader passes one to the first Traveler.  That person has 2 and the Reader has none.  As the first Travelor likes the choices given to them passes the pennies to the other people.  The Traveler like both the contributions of one other person (who was not the Reader) so that person ended up with 3 pennies, the first Traveler had 1 penny, and the Reader had none (this is starting to sound like a nursery rhyme).  <br/><br/>Now, at this point I got confused, was the person with 3 pennies to just accept being the next Traveler or was someone supposed to give a penny and say "I will help you remember", or something else I missed.  <br/><br/>We ended up just distributing enough pennies to make sure everyone had enough and kept playing but I felt let down that I'd missed how to do this correctly from the text.  Again, I prob just flubbed it.<br/><br/>We had no real problem with the narrative parts (other than just first time jitters) and they kept commenting that this would be a great way to teach the thought process or as a warm-up for writing.  They also thought it would be really cool to get high school seniors to do this in English class.  <br/><br/>Would you please help me with this so that the next time I drop this little bomb on someone it will go off more smoothly.  Thanks,  Scott                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221006/#Comment_221006" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T14:45:11+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  2:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint&amp;Sinner</cite>Now, at this point I got confused, was the person with 3 pennies to just accept being the next Traveler or was someone supposed to give a penny and say "I will help you remember", or something else I missed.</blockquote>\nThe person with three should be the Traveler. You only do the "I will help you remember" ritual if <i>no one</i> has enough pennies to be the Traveler (which is true at the very beginning of the game, when everyone has one). Otherwise you keep and use all of them in your next story.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221007/#Comment_221007" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T14:47:37+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  2:47PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I guess what I'm getting at is, is there something about these three scenarios that make them especially suitable for the game?

While the entire conceit of Penny is "remember your life," that's not what the third question asks.<br/><br/>Original -&gt; What event happened to cause you to lose your memory?<br/>Bourne -&gt; What happened with the package?<br/>Lovecraft -&gt; What do you know that can help us?<br/>(Roughly paraphrasing)<br/><br/>Because those settings ask for something specific, they allow the previous two to be more general about filling in the setting. The memories prior to the last serve the role of context-building. So you want settings where you'd have something interesting around which it build context.<br/><br/>To answer the question: a setting would work if there is a sense of a question to ask in that third memory, and something worth engaging to create the context in the first two. (Damn, that sounds too ivory tower of an answer, but I have to go to dinner now -- maybe later I can unpack that, if it's worth unpacking.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221093/#Comment_221093" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T07:42:41+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  7:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, no, saying "it's all about the third question" is a great answer.
